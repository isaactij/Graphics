the
return
of
the

by

hardy
preface
the
date
at
which
the
following
events
are
assumed
to
have
occurred
may
be
set
down
as
between
and
when
the
old
watering
place
herein
called
budmouth
still
retained
sufficient
afterglow
from
its
georgian
gaiety
and
prestige
to
lend
it
an
absorbing
attractiveness
to
the
romantic
and
imaginative
soul
of
a
lonely
dweller
inland
under
the
general
name
of
egdon
heath
which
has
been
given
to
the
sombre
scene
of
the
story
are
united
or
typified
heaths
of
various
real
names
to
the
number
of
at
least
a
dozen
these
being
virtually
one
in
character
and
aspect
though
their
original
unity
or
partial
unity
is
now
somewhat
disguised
by
intrusive
strips
and
slices
brought
under
the
plough
with
varying
degrees
of
success
or
planted
to
woodland
it
is
pleasant
to
dream
that
some
spot
in
the
extensive
tract
whose
southwestern
quarter
is
here
described
may
be
the
heath
of
that
traditionary
king
of
wessex
lear
july
to
sorrow
i
bade
good
morrow
and
thought
to
leave
her
far
away
behind
but
cheerly
cheerly
she
loves
me
dearly
she
is
so
constant
to
me
and
so
kind
i
would
deceive
her
and
so
leave
her
but
ah
she
is
so
constant
and
so
kind
book
one
the
three
women
a
face
on
which
time
makes
but
little
impression
a
saturday
afternoon
in
november
was
approaching
the
time
of
twilight
and
the
vast
tract
of
unenclosed
wild
known
as
egdon
heath
embrowned
itself
moment
by
moment
overhead
the
hollow
stretch
of
whitish
cloud
shutting
out
the
sky
was
as
a
tent
which
had
the
whole
heath
for
its
floor
the
heaven
being
spread
with
this
pallid
screen
and
the
earth
with
the
darkest
vegetation
their
meeting
line
at
the
horizon
was
clearly
marked
in
such
contrast
the
heath
wore
the
appearance
of
an
instalment
of
night
which
had
taken
up
its
place
before
its
astronomical
hour
was
come
darkness
had
to
a
great
extent
arrived
hereon
while
day
stood
distinct
in
the
sky
looking
upwards
a
furze
cutter
would
have
been
inclined
to
continue
work
looking
down
he
would
have
decided
to
finish
his
faggot
and
go
home
the
distant
rims
of
the
world
and
of
the
firmament
seemed
to
be
a
division
in
time
no
less
than
a
division
in
matter
the
face
of
the
heath
by
its
mere
complexion
added
half
an
hour
to
evening
it
could
in
like
manner
retard
the
dawn
sadden
noon
anticipate
the
frowning
of
storms
scarcely
generated
and
intensify
the
opacity
of
a
moonless
midnight
to
a
cause
of
shaking
and
dread
in
fact
precisely
at
this
transitional
point
of
its
nightly
roll
into
darkness
the
great
and
particular
glory
of
the
egdon
waste
began
and
nobody
could
be
said
to
understand
the
heath
who
had
not
been
there
at
such
a
time
it
could
best
be
felt
when
it
could
not
clearly
be
seen
its
complete
effect
and
explanation
lying
in
this
and
the
succeeding
hours
before
the
next
dawn
then
and
only
then
did
it
tell
its
true
tale
the
spot
was
indeed
a
near
relation
of
night
and
when
night
showed
itself
an
apparent
tendency
to
gravitate
together
could
be
perceived
in
its
shades
and
the
scene
the
sombre
stretch
of
rounds
and
hollows
seemed
to
rise
and
meet
the
evening
gloom
in
pure
sympathy
the
heath
exhaling
darkness
as
rapidly
as
the
heavens
precipitated
it
and
so
the
obscurity
in
the
air
and
the
obscurity
in
the
land
closed
together
in
a
black
fraternization
towards
which
each
advanced
halfway
the
place
became
full
of
a
watchful
intentness
now
for
when
other
things
sank
blooding
to
sleep
the
heath
appeared
slowly
to
awake
and
listen
every
night
its
titanic
form
seemed
to
await
something
but
it
had
waited
thus
unmoved
during
so
many
centuries
through
the
crises
of
so
many
things
that
it
could
only
be
imagined
to
await
one
last
crisis
the
final
overthrow
it
was
a
spot
which
returned
upon
the
memory
of
those
who
loved
it
with
an
aspect
of
peculiar
and
kindly
congruity
smiling
champaigns
of
flowers
and
fruit
hardly
do
this
for
they
are
permanently
harmonious
only
with
an
existence
of
better
reputation
as
to
its
issues
than
the
present
twilight
combined
with
the
scenery
of
egdon
heath
to
evolve
a
thing
majestic
without
severity
impressive
without
showiness
emphatic
in
its
admonitions
grand
in
its
simplicity
the
qualifications
which
frequently
invest
the
facade
of
a
prison
with
far
more
dignity
than
is
found
in
the
facade
of
a
palace
double
its
size
lent
to
this
heath
a
sublimity
in
which
spots
renowned
for
beauty
of
the
accepted
kind
are
utterly
wanting
fair
prospects
wed
happily
with
fair
times
but
alas
if
times
be
not
fair
men
have
oftener
suffered
from
the
mockery
of
a
place
too
smiling
for
their
reason
than
from
the
oppression
of
surroundings
oversadly
tinged
haggard
egdon
appealed
to
a
subtler
and
scarcer
instinct
to
a
more
recently
learnt
emotion
than
that
which
responds
to
the
sort
of
beauty
called
charming
and
fair
indeed
it
is
a
question
if
the
exclusive
reign
of
this
orthodox
beauty
is
not
approaching
its
last
quarter
the
new
vale
of
tempe
may
be
a
gaunt
waste
in
thule
human
souls
may
find
themselves
in
closer
and
closer
harmony
with
external
things
wearing
a
sombreness
distasteful
to
our
race
when
it
was
young
the
time
seems
near
if
it
has
not
actually
arrived
when
the
chastened
sublimity
of
a
moor
a
sea
or
a
mountain
will
be
all
of
nature
that
is
absolutely
in
keeping
with
the
moods
of
the
more
thinking
among
mankind
and
ultimately
to
the
commonest
tourist
spots
like
iceland
may
become
what
the
vineyards
and
myrtle
gardens
of
south
europe
are
to
him
now
and
heidelberg
and
baden
be
passed
unheeded
as
he
hastens
from
the
alps
to
the
sand
dunes
of
scheveningen
the
most
thoroughgoing
ascetic
could
feel
that
he
had
a
natural
right
to
wander
on
egdon
he
was
keeping
within
the
line
of
legitimate
indulgence
when
he
laid
himself
open
to
influences
such
as
these
colours
and
beauties
so
far
subdued
were
at
least
the
birthright
of
all
only
in
summer
days
of
highest
feather
did
its
mood
touch
the
level
of
gaiety
intensity
was
more
usually
reached
by
way
of
the
solemn
than
by
way
of
the
brilliant
and
such
a
sort
of
intensity
was
often
arrived
at
during
winter
darkness
tempests
and
mists
then
egdon
was
aroused
to
reciprocity
for
the
storm
was
its
lover
and
the
wind
its
friend
then
it
became
the
home
of
strange
phantoms
and
it
was
found
to
be
the
hitherto
unrecognized
original
of
those
wild
regions
of
obscurity
which
are
vaguely
felt
to
be
compassing
us
about
in
midnight
dreams
of
flight
and
disaster
and
are
never
thought
of
after
the
dream
till
revived
by
scenes
like
this
it
was
at
present
a
place
perfectly
accordant
with
man
s
nature
neither
ghastly
hateful
nor
ugly
neither
commonplace
unmeaning
nor
tame
but
like
man
slighted
and
enduring
and
withal
singularly
colossal
and
mysterious
in
its
swarthy
monotony
as
with
some
persons
who
have
long
lived
apart
solitude
seemed
to
look
out
of
its
countenance
it
had
a
lonely
face
suggesting
tragical
possibilities
this
obscure
obsolete
superseded
country
figures
in
domesday
its
condition
is
recorded
therein
as
that
of
heathy
furzy
briary
wilderness
bruaria
then
follows
the
length
and
breadth
in
leagues
and
though
some
uncertainty
exists
as
to
the
exact
extent
of
this
ancient
lineal
measure
it
appears
from
the
figures
that
the
area
of
egdon
down
to
the
present
day
has
but
little
diminished
turbaria
bruaria
the
right
of
cutting
heath

occurs
in
charters
relating
to
the
district
overgrown
with
heth
and
mosse
says
leland
of
the
same
dark
sweep
of
country
here
at
least
were
intelligible
facts
regarding
landscape
far
reaching
proofs
productive
of
genuine
satisfaction
the
untameable
ishmaelitish
thing
that
egdon
now
was
it
always
had
been
civilization
was
its
enemy
and
ever
since
the
beginning
of
vegetation
its
soil
had
worn
the
same
antique
brown
dress
the
natural
and
invariable
garment
of
the
particular
formation
in
its
venerable
one
coat
lay
a
certain
vein
of
satire
on
human
vanity
in
clothes
a
person
on
a
heath
in
raiment
of
modern
cut
and
colours
has
more
or
less
an
anomalous
look
we
seem
to
want
the
oldest
and
simplest
human
clothing
where
the
clothing
of
the
earth
is
so
primitive
to
recline
on
a
stump
of
thorn
in
the
central
valley
of
egdon
between
afternoon
and
night
as
now
where
the
eye
could
reach
nothing
of
the
world
outside
the
summits
and
shoulders
of
heathland
which
filled
the
whole
circumference
of
its
glance
and
to
know
that
everything
around
and
underneath
had
been
from
prehistoric
times
as
unaltered
as
the
stars
overhead
gave
ballast
to
the
mind
adrift
on
change
and
harassed
by
the
irrepressible
new
the
great
inviolate
place
had
an
ancient
permanence
which
the
sea
cannot
claim
who
can
say
of
a
particular
sea
that
it
is
old
distilled
by
the
sun
kneaded
by
the
moon
it
is
renewed
in
a
year
in
a
day
or
in
an
hour
the
sea
changed
the
fields
changed
the
rivers
the
villages
and
the
people
changed
yet
egdon
remained
those
surfaces
were
neither
so
steep
as
to
be
destructible
by
weather
nor
so
flat
as
to
be
the
victims
of
floods
and
deposits
with
the
exception
of
an
aged
highway
and
a
still
more
aged
barrow
presently
to
be
referred
to
themselves
almost
crystallized
to
natural
products
by
long
continuance
even
the
trifling
irregularities
were
not
caused
by
pickaxe
plough
or
spade
but
remained
as
the
very
finger
touches
of
the
last
geological
change
the
above
mentioned
highway
traversed
the
lower
levels
of
the
heath
from
one
horizon
to
another
in
many
portions
of
its
course
it
overlaid
an
old
vicinal
way
which
branched
from
the
great
western
road
of
the
romans
the
via
iceniana
or
ikenild
street
hard
by
on
the
evening
under
consideration
it
would
have
been
noticed
that
though
the
gloom
had
increased
sufficiently
to
confuse
the
minor
features
of
the
heath
the
white
surface
of
the
road
remained
almost
as
clear
as
ever
humanity
appears
upon
the
scene
hand
in
hand
with
trouble
along
the
road
walked
an
old
man
he
was
white
headed
as
a
mountain
bowed
in
the
shoulders
and
faded
in
general
aspect
he
wore
a
glazed
hat
an
ancient
boat
cloak
and
shoes
his
brass
buttons
bearing
an
anchor
upon
their
face
in
his
hand
was
a
silver
headed
walking
stick
which
he
used
as
a
veritable
third
leg
perseveringly
dotting
the
ground
with
its
point
at
every
few
inches
interval
one
would
have
said
that
he
had
been
in
his
day
a
naval
officer
of
some
sort
or
other
before
him
stretched
the
long
laborious
road
dry
empty
and
white
it
was
quite
open
to
the
heath
on
each
side
and
bisected
that
vast
dark
surface
like
the
parting
line
on
a
head
of
black
hair
diminishing
and
bending
away
on
the
furthest
horizon
the
old
man
frequently
stretched
his
eyes
ahead
to
gaze
over
the
tract
that
he
had
yet
to
traverse
at
length
he
discerned
a
long
distance
in
front
of
him
a
moving
spot
which
appeared
to
be
a
vehicle
and
it
proved
to
be
going
the
same
way
as
that
in
which
he
himself
was
journeying
it
was
the
single
atom
of
life
that
the
scene
contained
and
it
only
served
to
render
the
general
loneliness
more
evident
its
rate
of
advance
was
slow
and
the
old
man
gained
upon
it
sensibly
when
he
drew
nearer
he
perceived
it
to
be
a
spring
van
ordinary
in
shape
but
singular
in
colour
this
being
a
lurid
red
the
driver
walked
beside
it
and
like
his
van
he
was
completely
red
one
dye
of
that
tincture
covered
his
clothes
the
cap
upon
his
head
his
boots
his
face
and
his
hands
he
was
not
temporarily
overlaid
with
the
colour
it
permeated
him
the
old
man
knew
the
meaning
of
this
the
traveller
with
the
cart
was
a
reddleman
a
person
whose
vocation
it
was
to
supply
farmers
with
redding
for
their
sheep
he
was
one
of
a
class
rapidly
becoming
extinct
in
wessex
filling
at
present
in
the
rural
world
the
place
which
during
the
last
century
the
dodo
occupied
in
the
world
of
animals
he
is
a
curious
interesting
and
nearly
perished
link
between
obsolete
forms
of
life
and
those
which
generally
prevail
the
decayed
officer
by
degrees
came
up
alongside
his
fellow
wayfarer
and
wished
him
good
evening
the
reddleman
turned
his
head
and
replied
in
sad
and
occupied
tones
he
was
young
and
his
face
if
not
exactly
handsome
approached
so
near
to
handsome
that
nobody
would
have
contradicted
an
assertion
that
it
really
was
so
in
its
natural
colour
his
eye
which
glared
so
strangely
through
his
stain
was
in
itself
attractive
keen
as
that
of
a
bird
of
prey
and
blue
as
autumn
mist
he
had
neither
whisker
nor
moustache
which
allowed
the
soft
curves
of
the
lower
part
of
his
face
to
be
apparent
his
lips
were
thin
and
though
as
it
seemed
compressed
by
thought
there
was
a
pleasant
twitch
at
their
corners
now
and
then
he
was
clothed
throughout
in
a
tight
fitting
suit
of
corduroy
excellent
in
quality
not
much
worn
and
well
chosen
for
its
purpose
but
deprived
of
its
original
colour
by
his
trade
it
showed
to
advantage
the
good
shape
of
his
figure
a
certain
well
to
do
air
about
the
man
suggested
that
he
was
not
poor
for
his
degree
the
natural
query
of
an
observer
would
have
been
why
should
such
a
promising
being
as
this
have
hidden
his
prepossessing
exterior
by
adopting
that
singular
occupation
after
replying
to
the
old
man
s
greeting
he
showed
no
inclination
to
continue
in
talk
although
they
still
walked
side
by
side
for
the
elder
traveller
seemed
to
desire
company
there
were
no
sounds
but
that
of
the
booming
wind
upon
the
stretch
of
tawny
herbage
around
them
the
crackling
wheels
the
tread
of
the
men
and
the
footsteps
of
the
two
shaggy
ponies
which
drew
the
van
they
were
small
hardy
animals
of
a
breed
between
galloway
and
exmoor
and
were
known
as
heath
croppers
here
now
as
they
thus
pursued
their
way
the
reddleman
occasionally
left
his
companion
s
side
and
stepping
behind
the
van
looked
into
its
interior
through
a
small
window
the
look
was
always
anxious
he
would
then
return
to
the
old
man
who
made
another
remark
about
the
state
of
the
country
and
so
on
to
which
the
reddleman
again
abstractedly
replied
and
then
again
they
would
lapse
into
silence
the
silence
conveyed
to
neither
any
sense
of
awkwardness
in
these
lonely
places
wayfarers
after
a
first
greeting
frequently
plod
on
for
miles
without
speech
contiguity
amounts
to
a
tacit
conversation
where
otherwise
than
in
cities
such
contiguity
can
be
put
an
end
to
on
the
merest
inclination
and
where
not
to
put
an
end
to
it
is
intercourse
in
itself
possibly
these
two
might
not
have
spoken
again
till
their
parting
had
it
not
been
for
the
reddleman
s
visits
to
his
van
when
he
returned
from
his
fifth
time
of
looking
in
the
old
man
said
you
have
something
inside
there
besides
your
load
yes
somebody
who
wants
looking
after
yes
not
long
after
this
a
faint
cry
sounded
from
the
interior
the
reddleman
hastened
to
the
back
looked
in
and
came
away
again
you
have
a
child
there
my
man
no
sir
i
have
a
woman
the
deuce
you
have
why
did
she
cry
out
oh
she
has
fallen
asleep
and
not
being
used
to
traveling
she
s
uneasy
and
keeps
dreaming
a
young
woman
yes
a
young
woman
that
would
have
interested
me
forty
years
ago
perhaps
she
s
your
wife
my
wife
said
the
other
bitterly
she
s
above
mating
with
such
as
i
but
there
s
no
reason
why
i
should
tell
you
about
that
that
s
true
and
there
s
no
reason
why
you
should
not
what
harm
can
i
do
to
you
or
to
her
the
reddleman
looked
in
the
old
man
s
face
well
sir
he
said
at
last
i
knew
her
before
today
though
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
if
i
had
not
but
she
s
nothing
to
me
and
i
am
nothing
to
her
and
she
wouldn
t
have
been
in
my
van
if
any
better
carriage
had
been
there
to
take
her
where
may
i
ask
at
anglebury
i
know
the
town
well
what
was
she
doing
there
oh
not
much
to
gossip
about
however
she
s
tired
to
death
now
and
not
at
all
well
and
that
s
what
makes
her
so
restless
she
dropped
off
into
a
nap
about
an
hour
ago
and
twill
do
her
good
a
nice
looking
girl
no
doubt
you
would
say
so
the
other
traveller
turned
his
eyes
with
interest
towards
the
van
window
and
without
withdrawing
them
said
i
presume
i
might
look
in
upon
her
no
said
the
reddleman
abruptly
it
is
getting
too
dark
for
you
to
see
much
of
her
and
more
than
that
i
have
no
right
to
allow
you
thank
god
she
sleeps
so
well
i
hope
she
won
t
wake
till
she
s
home
who
is
she
one
of
the
neighbourhood
tis
no
matter
who
excuse
me
it
is
not
that
girl
of
blooms
end
who
has
been
talked
about
more
or
less
lately
if
so
i
know
her
and
i
can
guess
what
has
happened
tis
no
matter
now
sir
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
we
shall
soon
have
to
part
company
my
ponies
are
tired
and
i
have
further
to
go
and
i
am
going
to
rest
them
under
this
bank
for
an
hour
the
elder
traveller
nodded
his
head
indifferently
and
the
reddleman
turned
his
horses
and
van
in
upon
the
turf
saying
good
night
the
old
man
replied
and
proceeded
on
his
way
as
before
the
reddleman
watched
his
form
as
it
diminished
to
a
speck
on
the
road
and
became
absorbed
in
the
thickening
films
of
night
he
then
took
some
hay
from
a
truss
which
was
slung
up
under
the
van
and
throwing
a
portion
of
it
in
front
of
the
horses
made
a
pad
of
the
rest
which
he
laid
on
the
ground
beside
his
vehicle
upon
this
he
sat
down
leaning
his
back
against
the
wheel
from
the
interior
a
low
soft
breathing
came
to
his
ear
it
appeared
to
satisfy
him
and
he
musingly
surveyed
the
scene
as
if
considering
the
next
step
that
he
should
take
to
do
things
musingly
and
by
small
degrees
seemed
indeed
to
be
a
duty
in
the
egdon
valleys
at
this
transitional
hour
for
there
was
that
in
the
condition
of
the
heath
itself
which
resembled
protracted
and
halting
dubiousness
it
was
the
quality
of
the
repose
appertaining
to
the
scene
this
was
not
the
repose
of
actual
stagnation
but
the
apparent
repose
of
incredible
slowness
a
condition
of
healthy
life
so
nearly
resembling
the
torpor
of
death
is
a
noticeable
thing
of
its
sort
to
exhibit
the
inertness
of
the
desert
and
at
the
same
time
to
be
exercising
powers
akin
to
those
of
the
meadow
and
even
of
the
forest
awakened
in
those
who
thought
of
it
the
attentiveness
usually
engendered
by
understatement
and
reserve
the
scene
before
the
reddleman
s
eyes
was
a
gradual
series
of
ascents
from
the
level
of
the
road
backward
into
the
heart
of
the
heath
it
embraced
hillocks
pits
ridges
acclivities
one
behind
the
other
till
all
was
finished
by
a
high
hill
cutting
against
the
still
light
sky
the
traveller
s
eye
hovered
about
these
things
for
a
time
and
finally
settled
upon
one
noteworthy
object
up
there
it
was
a
barrow
this
bossy
projection
of
earth
above
its
natural
level
occupied
the
loftiest
ground
of
the
loneliest
height
that
the
heath
contained
although
from
the
vale
it
appeared
but
as
a
wart
on
an
atlantean
brow
its
actual
bulk
was
great
it
formed
the
pole
and
axis
of
this
heathery
world
as
the
resting
man
looked
at
the
barrow
he
became
aware
that
its
summit
hitherto
the
highest
object
in
the
whole
prospect
round
was
surmounted
by
something
higher
it
rose
from
the
semiglobular
mound
like
a
spike
from
a
helmet
the
first
instinct
of
an
imaginative
stranger
might
have
been
to
suppose
it
the
person
of
one
of
the
celts
who
built
the
barrow
so
far
had
all
of
modern
date
withdrawn
from
the
scene
it
seemed
a
sort
of
last
man
among
them
musing
for
a
moment
before
dropping
into
eternal
night
with
the
rest
of
his
race
there
the
form
stood
motionless
as
the
hill
beneath
above
the
plain
rose
the
hill
above
the
hill
rose
the
barrow
and
above
the
barrow
rose
the
figure
above
the
figure
was
nothing
that
could
be
mapped
elsewhere
than
on
a
celestial
globe
such
a
perfect
delicate
and
necessary
finish
did
the
figure
give
to
the
dark
pile
of
hills
that
it
seemed
to
be
the
only
obvious
justification
of
their
outline
without
it
there
was
the
dome
without
the
lantern
with
it
the
architectural
demands
of
the
mass
were
satisfied
the
scene
was
strangely
homogeneous
in
that
the
vale
the
upland
the
barrow
and
the
figure
above
it
amounted
only
to
unity
looking
at
this
or
that
member
of
the
group
was
not
observing
a
complete
thing
but
a
fraction
of
a
thing
the
form
was
so
much
like
an
organic
part
of
the
entire
motionless
structure
that
to
see
it
move
would
have
impressed
the
mind
as
a
strange
phenomenon
immobility
being
the
chief
characteristic
of
that
whole
which
the
person
formed
portion
of
the
discontinuance
of
immobility
in
any
quarter
suggested
confusion
yet
that
is
what
happened
the
figure
perceptibly
gave
up
its
fixity
shifted
a
step
or
two
and
turned
round
as
if
alarmed
it
descended
on
the
right
side
of
the
barrow
with
the
glide
of
a
water
drop
down
a
bud
and
then
vanished
the
movement
had
been
sufficient
to
show
more
clearly
the
characteristics
of
the
figure
and
that
it
was
a
woman
s
the
reason
of
her
sudden
displacement
now
appeared
with
her
dropping
out
of
sight
on
the
right
side
a
newcomer
bearing
a
burden
protruded
into
the
sky
on
the
left
side
ascended
the
tumulus
and
deposited
the
burden
on
the
top
a
second
followed
then
a
third
a
fourth
a
fifth
and
ultimately
the
whole
barrow
was
peopled
with
burdened
figures
the
only
intelligible
meaning
in
this
sky
backed
pantomime
of
silhouettes
was
that
the
woman
had
no
relation
to
the
forms
who
had
taken
her
place
was
sedulously
avoiding
these
and
had
come
thither
for
another
object
than
theirs
the
imagination
of
the
observer
clung
by
preference
to
that
vanished
solitary
figure
as
to
something
more
interesting
more
important
more
likely
to
have
a
history
worth
knowing
than
these
newcomers
and
unconsciously
regarded
them
as
intruders
but
they
remained
and
established
themselves
and
the
lonely
person
who
hitherto
had
been
queen
of
the
solitude
did
not
at
present
seem
likely
to
return
the
custom
of
the
country
had
a
looker
on
been
posted
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
barrow
he
would
have
learned
that
these
persons
were
boys
and
men
of
the
neighbouring
hamlets
each
as
he
ascended
the
barrow
had
been
heavily
laden
with
furze
faggots
carried
upon
the
shoulder
by
means
of
a
long
stake
sharpened
at
each
end
for
impaling
them
easily
two
in
front
and
two
behind
they
came
from
a
part
of
the
heath
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
the
rear
where
furze
almost
exclusively
prevailed
as
a
product
every
individual
was
so
involved
in
furze
by
his
method
of
carrying
the
faggots
that
he
appeared
like
a
bush
on
legs
till
he
had
thrown
them
down
the
party
had
marched
in
trail
like
a
travelling
flock
of
sheep
that
is
to
say
the
strongest
first
the
weak
and
young
behind
the
loads
were
all
laid
together
and
a
pyramid
of
furze
thirty
feet
in
circumference
now
occupied
the
crown
of
the
tumulus
which
was
known
as
rainbarrow
for
many
miles
round
some
made
themselves
busy
with
matches
and
in
selecting
the
driest
tufts
of
furze
others
in
loosening
the
bramble
bonds
which
held
the
faggots
together
others
again
while
this
was
in
progress
lifted
their
eyes
and
swept
the
vast
expanse
of
country
commanded
by
their
position
now
lying
nearly
obliterated
by
shade
in
the
valleys
of
the
heath
nothing
save
its
own
wild
face
was
visible
at
any
time
of
day
but
this
spot
commanded
a
horizon
enclosing
a
tract
of
far
extent
and
in
many
cases
lying
beyond
the
heath
country
none
of
its
features
could
be
seen
now
but
the
whole
made
itself
felt
as
a
vague
stretch
of
remoteness
while
the
men
and
lads
were
building
the
pile
a
change
took
place
in
the
mass
of
shade
which
denoted
the
distant
landscape
red
suns
and
tufts
of
fire
one
by
one
began
to
arise
flecking
the
whole
country
round
they
were
the
bonfires
of
other
parishes
and
hamlets
that
were
engaged
in
the
same
sort
of
commemoration
some
were
distant
and
stood
in
a
dense
atmosphere
so
that
bundles
of
pale
straw
like
beams
radiated
around
them
in
the
shape
of
a
fan
some
were
large
and
near
glowing
scarlet
red
from
the
shade
like
wounds
in
a
black
hide
some
were
maenades
with
winy
faces
and
blown
hair
these
tinctured
the
silent
bosom
of
the
clouds
above
them
and
lit
up
their
ephemeral
caves
which
seemed
thenceforth
to
become
scalding
caldrons
perhaps
as
many
as
thirty
bonfires
could
be
counted
within
the
whole
bounds
of
the
district
and
as
the
hour
may
be
told
on
a
clock
face
when
the
figures
themselves
are
invisible
so
did
the
men
recognize
the
locality
of
each
fire
by
its
angle
and
direction
though
nothing
of
the
scenery
could
be
viewed
the
first
tall
flame
from
rainbarrow
sprang
into
the
sky
attracting
all
eyes
that
had
been
fixed
on
the
distant
conflagrations
back
to
their
own
attempt
in
the
same
kind
the
cheerful
blaze
streaked
the
inner
surface
of
the
human
circle
now
increased
by
other
stragglers
male
and
female
with
its
own
gold
livery
and
even
overlaid
the
dark
turf
around
with
a
lively
luminousness
which
softened
off
into
obscurity
where
the
barrow
rounded
downwards
out
of
sight
it
showed
the
barrow
to
be
the
segment
of
a
globe
as
perfect
as
on
the
day
when
it
was
thrown
up
even
the
little
ditch
remaining
from
which
the
earth
was
dug
not
a
plough
had
ever
disturbed
a
grain
of
that
stubborn
soil
in
the
heath
s
barrenness
to
the
farmer
lay
its
fertility
to
the
historian
there
had
been
no
obliteration
because
there
had
been
no
tending
it
seemed
as
if
the
bonfire
makers
were
standing
in
some
radiant
upper
story
of
the
world
detached
from
and
independent
of
the
dark
stretches
below
the
heath
down
there
was
now
a
vast
abyss
and
no
longer
a
continuation
of
what
they
stood
on
for
their
eyes
adapted
to
the
blaze
could
see
nothing
of
the
deeps
beyond
its
influence
occasionally
it
is
true
a
more
vigorous
flare
than
usual
from
their
faggots
sent
darting
lights
like
aides
de
camp
down
the
inclines
to
some
distant
bush
pool
or
patch
of
white
sand
kindling
these
to
replies
of
the
same
colour
till
all
was
lost
in
darkness
again
then
the
whole
black
phenomenon
beneath
represented
limbo
as
viewed
from
the
brink
by
the
sublime
florentine
in
his
vision
and
the
muttered
articulations
of
the
wind
in
the
hollows
were
as
complaints
and
petitions
from
the
souls
of
mighty
worth
suspended
therein
it
was
as
if
these
men
and
boys
had
suddenly
dived
into
past
ages
and
fetched
therefrom
an
hour
and
deed
which
had
before
been
familiar
with
this
spot
the
ashes
of
the
original
british
pyre
which
blazed
from
that
summit
lay
fresh
and
undisturbed
in
the
barrow
beneath
their
tread
the
flames
from
funeral
piles
long
ago
kindled
there
had
shone
down
upon
the
lowlands
as
these
were
shining
now
festival
fires
to
thor
and
woden
had
followed
on
the
same
ground
and
duly
had
their
day
indeed
it
is
pretty
well
known
that
such
blazes
as
this
the
heathmen
were
now
enjoying
are
rather
the
lineal
descendants
from
jumbled
druidical
rites
and
saxon
ceremonies
than
the
invention
of
popular
feeling
about
gunpowder
plot
moreover
to
light
a
fire
is
the
instinctive
and
resistant
act
of
man
when
at
the
winter
ingress
the
curfew
is
sounded
throughout
nature
it
indicates
a
spontaneous
promethean
rebelliousness
against
that
fiat
that
this
recurrent
season
shall
bring
foul
times
cold
darkness
misery
and
death
black
chaos
comes
and
the
fettered
gods
of
the
earth
say
let
there
be
light
the
brilliant
lights
and
sooty
shades
which
struggled
upon
the
skin
and
clothes
of
the
persons
standing
round
caused
their
lineaments
and
general
contours
to
be
drawn
with
dureresque
vigour
and
dash
yet
the
permanent
moral
expression
of
each
face
it
was
impossible
to
discover
for
as
the
nimble
flames
towered
nodded
and
swooped
through
the
surrounding
air
the
blots
of
shade
and
flakes
of
light
upon
the
countenances
of
the
group
changed
shape
and
position
endlessly
all
was
unstable
quivering
as
leaves
evanescent
as
lightning
shadowy
eye
sockets
deep
as
those
of
a
death
s
head
suddenly
turned
into
pits
of
lustre
a
lantern
jaw
was
cavernous
then
it
was
shining
wrinkles
were
emphasized
to
ravines
or
obliterated
entirely
by
a
changed
ray
nostrils
were
dark
wells
sinews
in
old
necks
were
gilt
mouldings
things
with
no
particular
polish
on
them
were
glazed
bright
objects
such
as
the
tip
of
a
furze
hook
one
of
the
men
carried
were
as
glass
eyeballs
glowed
like
little
lanterns
those
whom
nature
had
depicted
as
merely
quaint
became
grotesque
the
grotesque
became
preternatural
for
all
was
in
extremity
hence
it
may
be
that
the
face
of
an
old
man
who
had
like
others
been
called
to
the
heights
by
the
rising
flames
was
not
really
the
mere
nose
and
chin
that
it
appeared
to
be
but
an
appreciable
quantity
of
human
countenance
he
stood
complacently
sunning
himself
in
the
heat
with
a
speaker
or
stake
he
tossed
the
outlying
scraps
of
fuel
into
the
conflagration
looking
at
the
midst
of
the
pile
occasionally
lifting
his
eyes
to
measure
the
height
of
the
flame
or
to
follow
the
great
sparks
which
rose
with
it
and
sailed
away
into
darkness
the
beaming
sight
and
the
penetrating
warmth
seemed
to
breed
in
him
a
cumulative
cheerfulness
which
soon
amounted
to
delight
with
his
stick
in
his
hand
he
began
to
jig
a
private
minuet
a
bunch
of
copper
seals
shining
and
swinging
like
a
pendulum
from
under
his
waistcoat
he
also
began
to
sing
in
the
voice
of
a
bee
up
a
flue

that

want

prevented
a
continuance
of
the
song
and
the
breakdown
attracted
the
attention
of
a
firm
standing
man
of
middle
age
who
kept
each
corner
of
his
crescent
shaped
mouth
rigorously
drawn
back
into
his
cheek
as
if
to
do
away
with
any
suspicion
of
mirthfulness
which
might
erroneously
have
attached
to
him
a

if
i
couldn

make
a
little

long
ways
i
should
seem

than
the
most

timothy

how
about
the
new
married
folks
down
there
at
the
quiet
woman
inn
the
other
inquired
pointing
towards
a
dim
light
in
the
direction
of
the
distant
highway
but
considerably
apart
from
where
the
reddleman
was
at
that
moment
resting
what
s
the
rights
of
the
matter
about
em
you
ought
to
know
being
an
understanding
man
but
a
little
rakish
hey
i
own
to
it
master
cantle
is
that
or
he
s
nothing
yet
tis
a
gay
fault
neigbbour
fairway
that
age
will
cure
i
heard
that
they
were
coming
home
tonight
by
this
time
they
must
have
come
what
besides
the
next
thing
is
for
us

go
and
wish

i
thought

in

anor
go
like
fri
ar
and
his
bro
ther
i
met
mis
ess
yeobright
the
young
bride
s
aunt
last
night
and
she
told
me
that
her
son
clym
was
coming
home
a
christmas
wonderful
clever
a
believe
ah
i
should
like
to
have
all
that
s
under
that
young
man
s
hair
well
then
i
spoke
to
her
in
my
well
known
merry
way
and
she
said
o
that
what
s
shaped
so
venerable
should
talk
like
a
fool
that
s
what
she
said
to
me
i
don
t
care
for
her
be
jowned
if
i
do
and
so
i
told
her
be
jowned
if
i
care
for
ee
i
said
i
had
her
there
hey
i
rather
think
she
had
you
said
fairway
no
said
grandfer
cantle
his
countenance
slightly
flagging
tisn
t
so
bad
as
that
with
me
seemingly
tis
however
is
it
because
of
the
wedding
that
clym
is
coming
home
a
christmas
to
make
a
new
arrangement
because
his
mother
is
now
left
in
the
house
alone
yes
yes
that
s
it
but
timothy
hearken
to
me
said
the
grandfer
earnestly
though
known
as
such
a
joker
i
be
an
understanding
man
if
you
catch
me
serious
and
i
am
serious
now
i
can
tell
ee
lots
about
the
married
couple
yes
this
morning
at
six
o
clock
they
went
up
the
country
to
do
the
job
and
neither
vell
nor
mark
have
been
seen
of
em
since
though
i
reckon
that
this
afternoon
has
brought
em
home
again
man
and
woman
wife
that
is
isn
t
it
spoke
like
a
man
timothy
and
wasn
t
mis
ess
yeobright
wrong
about
me
yes
it
will
do
i
didn
t
know
the
two
had
walked
together
since
last
fall
when
her
aunt
forbad
the
banns
how
long
has
this
new
set
to
been
in
mangling
then
do
you
know
humphrey
yes
how
long
said
grandfer
cantle
smartly
likewise
turning
to
humphrey
i
ask
that
question
ever
since
her
aunt
altered
her
mind
and
said
she
might
have
the
man
after
all
replied
humphrey
without
removing
his
eyes
from
the
fire
he
was
a
somewhat
solemn
young
fellow
and
carried
the
hook
and
leather
gloves
of
a
furze
cutter
his
legs
by
reason
of
that
occupation
being
sheathed
in
bulging
leggings
as
stiff
as
the
philistine
s
greaves
of
brass
that
s
why
they
went
away
to
be
married
i
count
you
see
after
kicking
up
such
a
nunny
watch
and
forbidding
the
banns
twould
have
made
mis
ess
yeobright
seem
foolish
like
to
have
a
banging
wedding
in
the
same
parish
all
as
if
she
d
never
gainsaid
it
exactly
seem
foolish
like
and
that
s
very
bad
for
the
poor
things
that
be
so
though
i
only
guess
as
much
to
be
sure
said
grandfer
cantle
still
strenuously
preserving
a
sensible
bearing
and
mien
ah
well
i
was
at
church
that
day
said
fairway
which
was
a
very
curious
thing
to
happen
if
twasn
t
my
name
s
simple
said
the
grandfer
emphatically
i
ha
n
t
been
there
to
year
and
now
the
winter
is
a
coming
on
i
won
t
say
i
shall
i
ha
n
t
been
these
three
years
said
humphrey
for
i
m
so
dead
sleepy
of
a
sunday
and
tis
so
terrible
far
to
get
there
and
when
you
do
get
there
tis
such
a
mortal
poor
chance
that
you
ll
be
chose
for
up
above
when
so
many
bain
t
that
i
bide
at
home
and
don
t
go
at
all
i
not
only
happened
to
be
there
said
fairway
with
a
fresh
collection
of
emphasis
but
i
was
sitting
in
the
same
pew
as
mis
ess
yeobright
and
though
you
may
not
see
it
as
such
it
fairly
made
my
blood
run
cold
to
hear
her
yes
it
is
a
curious
thing
but
it
made
my
blood
run
cold
for
i
was
close
at
her
elbow
the
speaker
looked
round
upon
the
bystanders
now
drawing
closer
to
hear
him
with
his
lips
gathered
tighter
than
ever
in
the
rigorousness
of
his
descriptive
moderation
tis
a
serious
job
to
have
things
happen
to
ee
there
said
a
woman
behind
ye
are
to
declare
it
was
the
parson
s
words
fairway
continued
and
then
up
stood
a
woman
at
my
side
a
touching
of
me
well
be
damned
if
there
isn
t
mis
ess
yeobright
a
standing
up
i
said
to
myself
yes
neighbours
though
i
was
in
the
temple
of
prayer
that
s
what
i
said
tis
against
my
conscience
to
curse
and
swear
in
company
and
i
hope
any
woman
here
will
overlook
it
still
what
i
did
say
i
did
say
and
twould
be
a
lie
if
i
didn
t
own
it
so
twould
neighbour
fairway
be
damned
if
there
isn
t
mis
ess
yeobright
a
standing
up
i
said
the
narrator
repeated
giving
out
the
bad
word
with
the
same
passionless
severity
of
face
as
before
which
proved
how
entirely
necessity
and
not
gusto
had
to
do
with
the
iteration
and
the
next
thing
i
heard
was
i
forbid
the
banns
from
her
i
ll
speak
to
you
after
the
service
said
the
parson
in
quite
a
homely
way
yes
turning
all
at
once
into
a
common
man
no
holier
than
you
or
i
ah
her
face
was
pale
maybe
you
can
call
to
mind
that
monument
in
weatherbury
church
the
cross
legged
soldier
that
have
had
his
arm
knocked
away
by
the
schoolchildren
well
he
would
about
have
matched
that
woman
s
face
when
she
said
i
forbid
the
banns
the
audience
cleared
their
throats
and
tossed
a
few
stalks
into
the
fire
not
because
these
deeds
were
urgent
but
to
give
themselves
time
to
weigh
the
moral
of
the
story
i
m
sure
when
i
heard
they
d
been
forbid
i
felt
as
glad
as
if
anybody
had
gied
me
sixpence
said
an
earnest
voice
that
of
olly
dowden
a
woman
who
lived
by
making
heath
brooms
or
besoms
her
nature
was
to
be
civil
to
enemies
as
well
as
to
friends
and
grateful
to
all
the
world
for
letting
her
remain
alive
and
now
the
maid
have
married
him
just
the
same
said
humphrey
after
that
mis
ess
yeobright
came
round
and
was
quite
agreeable
fairway
resumed
with
an
unheeding
air
to
show
that
his
words
were
no
appendage
to
humphrey
s
but
the
result
of
independent
reflection
supposing
they
were
ashamed
i
don
t
see
why
they
shouldn
t
have
done
it
here
right
said
a
wide
spread
woman
whose
stays
creaked
like
shoes
whenever
she
stooped
or
turned
tis
well
to
call
the
neighbours
together
and
to
hae
a
good
racket
once
now
and
then
and
it
may
as
well
be
when
there
s
a
wedding
as
at
tide
times
i
don
t
care
for
close
ways
ah
now
you
d
hardly
believe
it
but
i
don
t
care
for
gay
weddings
said
timothy
fairway
his
eyes
again
travelling
round
i
hardly
blame
thomasin
yeobright
and
neighbour
wildeve
for
doing
it
quiet
if
i
must
own
it
a
wedding
at
home
means
five
and
six
handed
reels
by
the
hour
and
they
do
a
man
s
legs
no
good
when
he
s
over
forty
true
once
at
the
woman
s
house
you
can
hardly
say
nay
to
being
one
in
a
jig
knowing
all
the
time
that
you
be
expected
to
make
yourself
worth
your
victuals
you
be
bound
to
dance
at
christmas
because
tis
the
time
o
year
you
must
dance
at
weddings
because
tis
the
time
o
life
at
christenings
folk
will
even
smuggle
in
a
reel
or
two
if
tis
no
further
on
than
the
first
or
second
chiel
and
this
is
not
naming
the
songs
you
ve
got
to
sing
for
my
part
i
like
a
good
hearty
funeral
as
well
as
anything
you
ve
as
splendid
victuals
and
drink
as
at
other
parties
and
even
better
and
it
don
t
wear
your
legs
to
stumps
in
talking
over
a
poor
fellow
s
ways
as
it
do
to
stand
up
in
hornpipes
nine
folks
out
of
ten
would
own
twas
going
too
far
to
dance
then
i
suppose
suggested
grandfer
cantle
tis
the
only
sort
of
party
a
staid
man
can
feel
safe
at
after
the
mug
have
been
round
a
few
times
well
i
can
t
understand
a
quiet
ladylike
little
body
like
tamsin
yeobright
caring
to
be
married
in
such
a
mean
way
said
susan
nunsuch
the
wide
woman
who
preferred
the
original
subject
tis
worse
than
the
poorest
do
and
i
shouldn
t
have
cared
about
the
man
though
some
may
say
he
s
good
looking
to
give
him
his
due
he
s
a
clever
learned
fellow
in
his
way
a
most
as
clever
as
clym
yeobright
used
to
be
he
was
brought
up
to
better
things
than
keeping
the
quiet
woman
an
engineer
that
s
what
the
man
was
as
we
know
but
he
threw
away
his
chance
and
so
a
took
a
public
house
to
live
his
learning
was
no
use
to
him
at
all
very
often
the
case
said
olly
the
besom
maker
and
yet
how
people
do
strive
after
it
and
get
it
the
class
of
folk
that
couldn
t
use
to
make
a
round
o
to
save
their
bones
from
the
pit
can
write
their
names
now
without
a
sputter
of
the
pen
oftentimes
without
a
single
blot
what
do
i
say
why
almost
without
a
desk
to
lean
their
stomachs
and
elbows
upon
true
tis
amazing
what
a
polish
the
world
have
been
brought
to
said
humphrey
why
afore
i
went
a
soldier
in
the
bang
up
locals
as
we
was
called
in
the
year
four
chimed
in
grandfer
cantle
brightly
i
didn
t
know
no
more
what
the
world
was
like
than
the
commonest
man
among
ye
and
now
jown
it
all
i
won
t
say
what
i
bain
t
fit
for
hey
couldst
sign
the
book
no
doubt
said
fairway
if
wast
young
enough
to
join
hands
with
a
woman
again
like
wildeve
and
mis
ess
tamsin
which
is
more
than
humph
there
could
do
for
he
follows
his
father
in
learning
ah
humph
well
i
can
mind
when
i
was
married
how
i
zid
thy
father
s
mark
staring
me
in
the
face
as
i
went
to
put
down
my
name
he
and
your
mother
were
the
couple
married
just
afore
we
were
and
there
stood
they
father
s
cross
with
arms
stretched
out
like
a
great
banging
scarecrow
what
a
terrible
black
cross
that
was
thy
father
s
very
likeness
in
en
to
save
my
soul
i
couldn
t
help
laughing
when
i
zid
en
though
all
the
time
i
was
as
hot
as
dog
days
what
with
the
marrying
and
what
with
the
woman
a
hanging
to
me
and
what
with
jack
changley
and
a
lot
more
chaps
grinning
at
me
through
church
window
but
the
next
moment
a
strawmote
would
have
knocked
me
down
for
i
called
to
mind
that
if
thy
father
and
mother
had
had
high
words
once
they
d
been
at
it
twenty
times
since
they
d
been
man
and
wife
and
i
zid
myself
as
the
next
poor
stunpoll
to
get
into
the
same
mess
ah
well
what
a
day
twas
wildeve
is
older
than
tamsin
yeobright
by
a
good
few
summers
a
pretty
maid
too
she
is
a
young
woman
with
a
home
must
be
a
fool
to
tear
her
smock
for
a
man
like
that
the
speaker
a
peat
or
turf
cutter
who
had
newly
joined
the
group
carried
across
his
shoulder
the
singular
heart
shaped
spade
of
large
dimensions
used
in
that
species
of
labour
and
its
well
whetted
edge
gleamed
like
a
silver
bow
in
the
beams
of
the
fire
a
hundred
maidens
would
have
had
him
if
he
d
asked
em
said
the
wide
woman
didst
ever
know
a
man
neighbour
that
no
woman
at
all
would
marry

humphrey

the
turf
cutter
nor
i
said
another
nor
i
said
grandfer
cantle
well
now

did
once
said
timothy
fairway
adding
more
firmness
to
one
of
his
legs
i
did
know
of
such
a
man
but
only
once
mind
he
gave
his
throat
a
thorough
rake
round
as
if
it
were
the
duty
of
every
person
not
to
be
mistaken
through
thickness
of
voice
yes
i
knew
of
such
a
man
he
said
and
what
ghastly
gallicrow
might
the
poor
fellow
have
been
like
master
fairway
asked
the
turf
cutter

said
fairway
with

a
faltering
man
with
reedy
hair
no
shoulders
and
a
great
quantity
of
wrist
and
ankle
beyond
his
clothes
advanced
a
step
or

by
his

he
turned
upon
them
his
painfully
circular
eyes
surrounded
by
concentric
lines
like
targets
no
that
s
true
but
tis
a
melancholy
thing
and
my
blood
ran
cold
when
you
spoke
for
i
felt
there
were
two
poor
fellows
where
i
had
thought
only
one
tis
a
sad
thing
for
ye
christian
how
st
know
the
women
won
t
hae
thee
i
ve
asked
em
sure
i
should
never
have
thought
you
had
the
face
well
and
what
did
the
last
one
say
to
ye
nothing
that
can
t
be
got
over
perhaps
after
all
get
out
of
my
sight
you
slack
twisted
slim
looking
maphrotight
fool
was
the
woman
s
words
to
me
not
encouraging
i
own
said
fairway
get
out
of
my
sight
you
slack
twisted
slim
looking
maphrotight
fool
is
rather
a
hard
way
of
saying
no
but
even
that
might
be
overcome
by
time
and
patience
so
as
to
let
a
few
grey
hairs
show
themselves
in
the
hussy
s
head
how
old
be
you
christian
thirty
one
last
tatie
digging
mister
fairway
not
a
boy
not
a
boy
still
there
s
hope
yet
that
s
my
age
by
baptism
because
that
s
put
down
in
the
great
book
of
the
judgment
that
they
keep
in
church
vestry
but
mother
told
me
i
was
born
some
time
afore
i
was
christened
ah
but
she
couldn
t
tell
when
to
save
her
life
except
that
there
was
no
moon
no
moon
that
s
bad
hey
neighbours
that
s
bad
for
him
yes
tis
bad
said
grandfer
cantle
shaking
his
head
mother
know
d
twas
no
moon
for
she
asked
another
woman
that
had
an
almanac
as
she
did
whenever
a
boy
was
born
to
her
because
of
the
saying
no
moon
no
man
which
made
her
afeard
every
man
child
she
had
do
ye
really
think
it
serious
mister
fairway
that
there
was
no
moon
yes
no
moon
no
man
tis
one
of
the
truest
sayings
ever
spit
out
the
boy
never
comes
to
anything
that
s
born
at
new
moon
a
bad
job
for
thee
christian
that
you
should
have
showed
your
nose
then
of
all
days
in
the
month
i
suppose
the
moon
was
terrible
full
when
you
were
born
said
christian
with
a
look
of
hopeless
admiration
at
fairway
well
a
was
not
new
mr
fairway
replied
with
a
disinterested
gaze
i
d
sooner
go
without
drink
at
lammas
tide
than
be
a
man
of
no
moon
continued
christian
in
the
same
shattered
recitative
tis
said
i
be
only
the
rames
of
a
man
and
no
good
for
my
race
at
all
and
i
suppose
that
s
the
cause
o
t
ay
said
grandfer
cantle
somewhat
subdued
in
spirit
and
yet
his
mother
cried
for
scores
of
hours
when
a
was
a
boy
for
fear
he
should
outgrow
hisself
and
go
for
a
soldier
well
there
s
many
just
as
bad
as
he
said
fairway
wethers
must
live
their
time
as
well
as
other
sheep
poor
soul
so
perhaps
i
shall
rub
on
ought
i
to
be
afeared
o
nights
master
fairway
you
ll
have
to
lie
alone
all
your
life
and
tis
not
to
married
couples
but
to
single
sleepers
that
a
ghost
shows
himself
when
a
do
come
one
has
been
seen
lately
too
a
very
strange
one
no
don
t
talk
about
it
if
tis
agreeable
of
ye
not
to
twill
make
my
skin
crawl
when
i
think
of
it
in
bed
alone
but
you
will
ah
you
will
i
know
timothy
and
i
shall
dream
all
night
o
t
a
very
strange
one
what
sort
of
a
spirit
did
ye
mean
when
ye
said
a
very
strange
one
timothy
no
no
don
t
tell
me
i
don
t
half
believe
in
spirits
myself
but
i
think
it
ghostly
enough
what
i
was
told
twas
a
little
boy
that
zid
it
what
was
it
like
no
don
t
a
red
one
yes
most
ghosts
be
white
but
this
is
as
if
it
had
been
dipped
in
blood
christian
drew
a
deep
breath
without
letting
it
expand
his
body
and
humphrey
said
where
has
it
been
seen
not
exactly
here
but
in
this
same
heth
but
tisn
t
a
thing
to
talk
about
what
do
ye
say
continued
fairway
in
brisker
tones
and
turning
upon
them
as
if
the
idea
had
not
been
grandfer
cantle
s
what
do
you
say
to
giving
the
new
man
and
wife
a
bit
of
a
song
tonight
afore
we
go
to
bed
being
their
wedding
day
when
folks
are
just
married
tis
as
well
to
look
glad
o
t
since
looking
sorry
won
t
unjoin
em
i
am
no
drinker
as
we
know
but
when
the
womenfolk
and
youngsters
have
gone
home
we
can
drop
down
across
to
the
quiet
woman
and
strike
up
a
ballet
in
front
of
the
married
folks
door
twill
please
the
young
wife
and
that
s
what
i
should
like
to
do
for
many
s
the
skinful
i
ve
had
at
her
hands
when
she
lived
with
her
aunt
at
blooms
end
hey
and
so
we
will
said
grandfer
cantle
turning
so
briskly
that
his
copper
seals
swung
extravagantly
i
m
as
dry
as
a
kex
with
biding
up
here
in
the
wind
and
i
haven
t
seen
the
colour
of
drink
since
nammet
time
today
tis
said
that
the
last
brew
at
the
woman
is
very
pretty
drinking
and
neighbours
if
we
should
be
a
little
late
in
the
finishing
why
tomorrow
s
sunday
and
we
can
sleep
it
off
grandfer
cantle
you
take
things
very
careless
for
an
old
man
said
the
wide
woman
i
take
things
careless
i
do
too
careless
to
please
the
women
klk
i
ll
sing
the
jovial
crew
or
any
other
song
when
a
weak
old
man
would
cry
his
eyes
out
jown

i
am

what
we

do
said

we

song

the
lord
what
s
the
good
of
thomasin
s
cousin
clym
a
coming
home
after
the
deed
s
done
he
should
have
come
afore
if
so
be
he
wanted
to
stop
it
and
marry
her
himself
perhaps
he
s
coming
to
bide
with
his
mother
a
little
time
as
she
must
feel
lonely
now
the
maid
s
gone
now
tis
very
odd
but
i
never
feel
lonely
no
not
at
all
said
grandfer
cantle
i
am
as
brave
in
the
nighttime
as
a
admiral
the
bonfire
was
by
this
time
beginning
to
sink
low
for
the
fuel
had
not
been
of
that
substantial
sort
which
can
support
a
blaze
long
most
of
the
other
fires
within
the
wide
horizon
were
also
dwindling
weak
attentive
observation
of
their
brightness
colour
and
length
of
existence
would
have
revealed
the
quality
of
the
material
burnt
and
through
that
to
some
extent
the
natural
produce
of
the
district
in
which
each
bonfire
was
situate
the
clear
kingly
effulgence
that
had
characterized
the
majority
expressed
a
heath
and
furze
country
like
their
own
which
in
one
direction
extended
an
unlimited
number
of
miles
the
rapid
flares
and
extinctions
at
other
points
of
the
compass
showed
the
lightest
of
fuel
straw
beanstalks
and
the
usual
waste
from
arable
land
the
most
enduring
of
all
steady
unaltering
eyes
like
planets
signified
wood
such
as
hazel
branches
thorn
faggots
and
stout
billets
fires
of
the
last
mentioned
materials
were
rare
and
though
comparatively
small
in
magnitude
beside
the
transient
blazes
now
began
to
get
the
best
of
them
by
mere
long
continuance
the
great
ones
had
perished
but
these
remained
they
occupied
the
remotest
visible
positions
sky
backed
summits
rising
out
of
rich
coppice
and
plantation
districts
to
the
north
where
the
soil
was
different
and
heath
foreign
and
strange
save
one
and
this
was
the
nearest
of
any
the
moon
of
the
whole
shining
throng
it
lay
in
a
direction
precisely
opposite
to
that
of
the
little
window
in
the
vale
below
its
nearness
was
such
that
notwithstanding
its
actual
smallness
its
glow
infinitely
transcended
theirs
this
quiet
eye
had
attracted
attention
from
time
to
time
and
when
their
own
fire
had
become
sunken
and
dim
it
attracted
more
some
even
of
the
wood
fires
more
recently
lighted
had
reached
their
decline
but
no
change
was
perceptible
here
to
be
sure
how
near
that
fire
is
said
fairway
seemingly
i
can
see
a
fellow
of
some
sort
walking
round
it
little
and
good
must
be
said
of
that
fire
surely
i
can
throw
a
stone
there
said
the
boy
and
so
can
i
said
grandfer
cantle
no
no
you
can
t
my
sonnies
that
fire
is
not
much
less
than
a
mile
off
for
all
that
a
seems
so
near
tis
in
the
heath
but
no
furze
said
the
turf
cutter
tis
cleft
wood
that
s
what
tis
said
timothy
fairway
nothing
would
burn
like
that
except
clean
timber
and
tis
on
the
knap
afore
the
old
captain
s
house
at
mistover
such
a
queer
mortal
as
that
man
is
to
have
a
little
fire
inside
your
own
bank
and
ditch
that
nobody
else
may
enjoy
it
or
come
anigh
it
and
what
a
zany
an
old
chap
must
be
to
light
a
bonfire
when
there
s
no
youngsters
to
please
cap
n
vye
has
been
for
a
long
walk
today
and
is
quite
tired
out
said
grandfer
cantle
so
tisn
t
likely
to
be
he
and
he
would
hardly
afford
good
fuel
like
that
said
the
wide
woman
then
it
must
be
his
granddaughter
said
fairway
not
that
a
body
of
her
age
can
want
a
fire
much
she
is
very
strange
in
her
ways
living
up
there
by
herself
and
such
things
please
her
said
susan
she
s
a
well
favoured
maid
enough
said
humphrey
the
furze
cutter
especially
when
she
s
got
one
of
her
dandy
gowns
on
that
s
true
said
fairway
well
let
her
bonfire
burn
an
t
will
ours
is
well
nigh
out
by
the
look
o
t
how
dark
tis
now
the
fire
s
gone
down
said
christian
cantle
looking
behind
him
with
his
hare
eyes
don
t
ye
think
we
d
better
get
home
along
neighbours
the
heth
isn
t
haunted
i
know
but
we
d
better
get
home
ah
what
was
that
only
the
wind
said
the
turf
cutter
i
don
t
think
fifth
of
novembers
ought
to
be
kept
up
by
night
except
in
towns
it
should
be
by
day
in
outstep
ill
accounted
places
like
this
nonsense
christian
lift
up
your
spirits
like
a
man
susy
dear
you
and
i
will
have
a
jig
hey
my
honey
before
tis
quite
too
dark
to
see
how
well
favoured
you
be
still
though
so
many
summers
have
passed
since
your
husband
a
son
of
a
witch
snapped
you
up
from
me
this
was
addressed
to
susan
nunsuch
and
the
next
circumstance
of
which
the
beholders
were
conscious
was
a
vision
of
the
matron
s
broad
form
whisking
off
towards
the
space
whereon
the
fire
had
been
kindled
she
was
lifted
bodily
by
mr
fairway
s
arm
which
had
been
flung
round
her
waist
before
she
had
become
aware
of
his
intention
the
site
of
the
fire
was
now
merely
a
circle
of
ashes
flecked
with
red
embers
and
sparks
the
furze
having
burnt
completely
away
once
within
the
circle
he
whirled
her
round
and
round
in
a
dance
she
was
a
woman
noisily
constructed
in
addition
to
her
enclosing
framework
of
whalebone
and
lath
she
wore
pattens
summer
and
winter
in
wet
weather
and
in
dry
to
preserve
her
boots
from
wear
and
when
fairway
began
to
jump
about
with
her
the
clicking
of
the
pattens
the
creaking
of
the
stays
and
her
screams
of
surprise
formed
a
very
audible
concert
i
ll
crack
thy
numskull
for
thee
you
mandy
chap
said
mrs
nunsuch
as
she
helplessly
danced
round
with
him
her
feet
playing
like
drumsticks
among
the
sparks
my
ankles
were
all
in
a
fever
before
from
walking
through
that
prickly
furze
and
now
you
must
make
em
worse
with
these
vlankers
the
vagary
of
timothy
fairway
was
infectious
the
turf
cutter
seized
old
olly
dowden
and
somewhat
more
gently
poussetted
with
her
likewise
the
young
men
were
not
slow
to
imitate
the
example
of
their
elders
and
seized
the
maids
grandfer
cantle
and
his
stick
jigged
in
the
form
of
a
three
legged
object
among
the
rest
and
in
half
a
minute
all
that
could
be
seen
on
rainbarrow
was
a
whirling
of
dark
shapes
amid
a
boiling
confusion
of
sparks
which
leapt
around
the
dancers
as
high
as
their
waists
the
chief
noises
were
women
s
shrill
cries
men
s
laughter
susan
s
stays
and
pattens
olly
dowden
s
heu
heu
heu
and
the
strumming
of
the
wind
upon
the
furze
bushes
which
formed
a
kind
of
tune
to
the
demoniac
measure
they
trod
christian
alone
stood
aloof
uneasily
rocking
himself
as
he
murmured
they
ought
not
to
do
it
how
the
vlankers
do
fly
tis
tempting
the
wicked
one
tis
what
was
that
said
one
of
the
lads
stopping
ah
where
said
christian
hastily
closing
up
to
the
rest
the
dancers
all
lessened
their
speed
twas
behind
you
christian
that
i
heard
it
down
here
yes
tis
behind
me
christian
said
matthew
mark
luke
and
john
bless
the
bed
that
i
lie
on
four
angels

your
tongue

up
across
here
to
mis

to
them
in
the
same
voice
as
a
long
slim
indistinct
figure
approached
the
barrow
ought
we
not
to
run
home
as
hard
as
we
can
neighbours
as
tis
getting
late
said
christian
not
run
away
from
one
another
you
know
run
close
together
i
mean
scrape
up
a
few
stray
locks
of
furze
and
make
a
blaze
so
that
we
can
see
who
the
man
is
said
fairway
when
the
flame
arose
it
revealed
a
young
man
in
tight
raiment
and
red
from
top
to
toe
is
there
a
track
across
here
to
mis
ess
yeobright
s
house
he
repeated
ay
keep
along
the
path
down
there

way

horses
and
a
van
can
travel
over
well
yes
you
can
get
up
the
vale
below
here
with
time
the
track
is
rough
but
if

got
a
light
your
horses
may
pick
along
wi
care
have
ye
brought
your
cart
far
up
neighbour
reddleman
i
ve
left
it
in
the
bottom
about
half
a
mile
back
i
stepped
on
in
front
to
make
sure
of
the
way
as
tis
night
time
and
i
han
t
been
here
for
so
long
oh
well
you
can
get
up
said
fairway
what
a
turn
it
did
give
me
when
i
saw
him
he
added
to
the
whole
group
the
reddleman
included
lord
s
sake
i
thought
whatever
fiery
mommet
is
this
come
to
trouble
us
no
slight
to
your
looks
reddleman
for
ye
bain
t
bad
looking
in
the
groundwork
though
the
finish
is
queer
my
meaning
is
just
to
say
how
curious
i
felt
i
half
thought
it
twas
the
devil
or
the
red
ghost
the
boy
told
of
it
gied
me
a
turn
likewise
said
susan
nunsuch
for
i
had
a
dream
last
night
of
a
death

head
don
t
ye
talk
o
t
no
more
said
christian
if
he
had
a
handkerchief
over
his
head
he
d
look
for
all
the
world
like
the
devil
in
the
picture
of
the
temptation
well
thank
you
for
telling
me
said
the
young
reddleman
smiling
faintly
and
good
night
t
ye
all
he
withdrew
from
their
sight
down
the
barrow
i
fancy
i
ve
seen
that
young
man

face
before
said
humphrey
but
where
or
how
or
what
his
name
is
i
don
t
know
the
reddleman
had
not
been
gone
more
than
a
few
minutes
when
another
person
approached
the
partially
revived
bonfire
it
proved
to
be
a
well
known
and
respected
widow
of
the
neighbourhood
of
a
standing
which
can
only
be
expressed
by
the
word
genteel
her
face
encompassed
by
the
blackness
of
the
receding
heath
showed
whitely
and
with
out
half
lights
like
a
cameo
she
was
a
woman
of
middle
age
with
well
formed
features
of
the
type
usually
found
where
perspicacity
is
the
chief
quality
enthroned
within
at
moments
she
seemed
to
be
regarding
issues
from
a
nebo
denied
to
others
around
she
had
something
of
an
estranged
mien
the
solitude
exhaled
from
the
heath
was
concentrated
in
this
face
that
had
risen
from
it
the
air
with
which
she
looked
at
the
heathmen
betokened
a
certain
unconcern
at
their
presence
or
at
what
might
be
their
opinions
of
her
for
walking
in
that
lonely
spot
at
such
an
hour
thus
indirectly
implying
that
in
some
respect
or
other
they
were
not
up
to
her
level
the
explanation
lay
in
the
fact
that
though
her
husband
had
been
a
small
farmer
she
herself
was
a
curate
s
daughter
who
had
once
dreamt
of
doing
better
things
persons
with
any
weight
of
character
carry
like
planets
their
atmospheres
along
with
them
in
their
orbits
and
the
matron
who
entered
now
upon
the
scene
could
and
usually
did
bring
her
own
tone
into
a
company
her
normal
manner
among
the
heathfolk
had
that
reticence
which
results
from
the
consciousness
of
superior
communicative
power
but
the
effect
of
coming
into
society
and
light
after
lonely
wandering
in
darkness
is
a
sociability
in
the
comer
above
its
usual
pitch
expressed
in
the
features
even
more
than
in
words
why
tis
mis

mis

not
ten

mrs

looking
towards
the
fire
where

with
some
want
of
originality
was
dancing
by
himself
among
the
sparks
as
the
others

done
before

said
the
reveller
checking
himself
repentantly
i
ve
such
a
bad
memory
mis
ess
yeobright
that
i
forget
how
i
m
looked
up
to
by
the
rest
of
em
my
spirits
must
be
wonderful
good
you
ll
say
but
not
always
tis
a
weight
upon
a
man
to
be
looked
up
to
as
commander
and
i
often
feel
it
i
am
sorry
to
stop
the
talk
said
mrs
yeobright
but
i
must
be
leaving
you
now
i
was
passing
down
the
anglebury
road
towards
my
niece
s
new
home
who
is
returning
tonight
with
her
husband
and
seeing
the
bonfire
and
hearing
olly
s
voice
among
the
rest
i
came
up
here
to
learn
what
was
going
on
i
should
like
her
to
walk
with
me
as
her
way
is
mine
ay
sure
ma
am
i
m
just
thinking
of
moving
said
olly
why
you
ll
be
safe
to
meet
the
reddleman
that
i
told
ye
of
said
fairway
he
s
only
gone
back
to
get
his
van
we
heard
that
your
niece
and
her
husband
were
coming
straight
home
as
soon
as
they
were
married
and
we
are
going
down
there
shortly
to
give
em
a
song
o
welcome
thank
you
indeed
said
mrs
yeobright
but
we
shall
take
a
shorter
cut
through
the
furze
than
you
can
go
with
long
clothes
so
we
won
t
trouble
you
to
wait
very
well
are
you
ready
olly
yes
ma
am
and
there
s
a
light
shining
from
your
niece
s
window
see
it
will
help
to
keep
us
in
the
path
she
indicated
the
faint
light
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
which
fairway
had
pointed
out
and
the
two
women
descended
the
tumulus
the
halt
on
the
turnpike
road
down
downward
they
went
and
yet
further
down
their
descent
at
each
step
seeming
to
outmeasure
their
advance
their
skirts
were
scratched
noisily
by
the
furze
their
shoulders
brushed
by
the
ferns
which
though
dead
and
dry
stood
erect
as
when
alive
no
sufficient
winter
weather
having
as
yet
arrived
to
beat
them
down
their
tartarean
situation
might
by
some
have
been
called
an
imprudent
one
for
two
unattended
women
but
these
shaggy
recesses
were
at
all
seasons
a
familiar
surrounding
to
olly
and
mrs
yeobright
and
the
addition
of
darkness
lends
no
frightfulness
to
the
face
of
a
friend
and
so
tamsin
has
married
him
at
last
said
olly
when
the
incline
had
become
so
much
less
steep
that
their
foot
steps
no
longer
required
undivided
attention
mrs
yeobright
answered
slowly
yes
at
last
how
you
will
miss
her
living
with
ee
as
a
daughter
as
she
always
have
i
do
miss
her
olly
though
without
the
tact
to
perceive
when
remarks
were
untimely
was
saved
by
her
very
simplicity
from
rendering
them
offensive
questions
that
would
have
been
resented
in
others
she
could
ask
with
impunity
this
accounted
for
mrs
yeobright
s
acquiescence
in
the
revival
of
an
evidently
sore
subject
i
was
quite
strook
to
hear
you
d
agreed
to
it
ma
am
that
i
was
continued
the
besom
maker
you
were
not
more
struck
by
it
than
i
should
have
been
last
year
this
time
olly
there
are
a
good
many
sides
to
that
wedding
i
could
not
tell
you
all
of
them
even
if
i
tried
i
felt
myself
that
he
was
hardly
solid
going
enough
to
mate
with
your
family
keeping
an
inn
what
is
it
but
a
s
clever
that
s
true
and
they
say
he
was
an
engineering
gentleman
once
but
has
come
down
by
being
too
outwardly
given
i
saw
that
upon
the
whole
it
would
be
better
she
should
marry
where
she
wished
poor
little
thing
her
feelings
got
the
better
of
her
no
doubt
tis
nature
well
they
may
call
him
what
they
will
he
ve
several
acres
of
heth
ground
broke
up
here
besides
the
public
house
and
the
heth
croppers
and
his
manners
be
quite
like
a
gentleman
s
and
what
s
done
cannot
be
undone
it
cannot
said
mrs
yeobright
see
here
s
the
wagon
track
at
last
now
we
shall
get
along
better
the
wedding
subject
was
no
further
dwelt
upon
and
soon
a
faint
diverging
path
was
reached
where
they
parted
company
olly
first
begging
her
companion
to
remind
mr
wildeve
that
he
had
not
sent
her
sick
husband
the
bottle
of
wine
promised
on
the
occasion
of
his
marriage
the
besom
maker
turned
to
the
left
towards
her
own
house
behind
a
spur
of
the
hill
and
mrs
yeobright
followed
the
straight
track
which
further
on
joined
the
highway
by
the
quiet
woman
inn
whither
she
supposed
her
niece
to
have
returned
with
wildeve
from
their
wedding
at
anglebury
that
day
she
first
reached
wildeve
s
patch
as
it
was
called
a
plot
of
land
redeemed
from
the
heath
and
after
long
and
laborious
years
brought
into
cultivation
the
man
who
had
discovered
that
it
could
be
tilled
died
of
the
labour
the
man
who
succeeded
him
in
possession
ruined
himself
in
fertilizing
it
wildeve
came
like
amerigo
vespucci
and
received
the
honours
due
to
those
who
had
gone
before
when
mrs
yeobright
had
drawn
near
to
the
inn
and
was
about
to
enter
she
saw
a
horse
and
vehicle
some
two
hundred
yards
beyond
it
coming
towards
her
a
man
walking
alongside
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
it
was
soon
evident
that
this
was
the
reddleman
who
had
inquired
for
her
instead
of
entering
the
inn
at
once
she
walked
by
it
and
towards
the
van
the
conveyance
came
close
and
the
man
was
about
to
pass
her
with
little
notice
when
she
turned
to
him
and
said
i
think
you
have
been
inquiring
for
me
i
am
mrs
yeobright
of
blooms
end
the
reddleman
started
and
held
up
his
finger
he
stopped
the
horses
and
beckoned
to
her
to
withdraw
with
him
a
few
yards
aside
which
she
did
wondering
you
don
t
know
me
ma
am
i
suppose
he
said
i
do
not
said
she
why
yes
i
do
you
are
young
venn
your
father
was
a
dairyman
somewhere
here
yes
and
i
knew
your
niece
miss
tamsin
a
little
i
have
something
bad
to
tell
you
about
her
no
she
has
just
come
home
i
believe
with
her
husband
they
arranged
to
return
this
afternoon
to
the
inn
beyond
here
she
s
not
there
how
do
you
know
because
she
s
here
she
s
in
my
van
he
added
slowly
what
new
trouble
has
come
murmured
mrs
yeobright
putting
her
hand
over
her
eyes
i
can
t
explain
much
ma
am
all
i
know
is
that
as
i
was
going
along
the
road
this
morning
about
a
mile
out
of
anglebury
i
heard
something
trotting
after
me
like
a
doe
and
looking
round
there
she
was
white
as
death
itself
oh
diggory
venn
she
said
i
thought
twas
you
will
you
help
me
i
am
in
trouble
how
did
she
know
your
christian
name
said
mrs
yeobright
doubtingly
i
had
met
her
as
a
lad
before
i
went
away
in
this
trade
she
asked
then
if
she
might
ride
and
then
down
she
fell
in
a
faint
i
picked
her
up
and
put
her
in
and
there
she
has
been
ever
since
she
has
cried
a
good
deal
but
she
has
hardly
spoke
all
she
has
told
me
being
that
she
was
to
have
been
married
this
morning
i
tried
to
get
her
to
eat
something
but
she
couldn
t
and
at
last
she
fell
asleep
let
me
see
her
at
once
said
mrs
yeobright
hastening
towards
the
van
the
reddleman
followed
with
the
lantern
and
stepping
up
first
assisted
mrs
yeobright
to
mount
beside
him
on
the
door
being
opened
she
perceived
at
the
end
of
the
van
an
extemporized
couch
around
which
was
hung
apparently
all
the
drapery
that
the
reddleman
possessed
to
keep
the
occupant
of
the
little
couch
from
contact
with
the
red
materials
of
his
trade
a
young
girl
lay
thereon
covered
with
a
cloak
she
was
asleep
and
the
light
of
the
lantern
fell
upon
her
features
a
fair
sweet
and
honest
country
face
was
revealed
reposing
in
a
nest
of
wavy
chestnut
hair
it
was
between
pretty
and
beautiful
though
her
eyes
were
closed
one
could
easily
imagine
the
light
necessarily
shining
in
them
as
the
culmination
of
the
luminous
workmanship
around
the
groundwork
of
the
face
was
hopefulness
but
over
it
now
i
ay
like
a
foreign
substance
a
film
of
anxiety
and
grief
the
grief
had
been
there
so
shortly
as
to
have
abstracted
nothing
of
the
bloom
and
had
as
yet
but
given
a
dignity
to
what
it
might
eventually
undermine
the
scarlet
of
her
lips
had
not
had
time
to
abate
and
just
now
it
appeared
still
more
intense
by
the
absence
of
the
neighbouring
and
more
transient
colour
of
her
cheek
the
lips
frequently
parted
with
a
murmur
of
words
she
seemed
to
belong
rightly
to
a
madrigal
to
require
viewing
through
rhyme
and
harmony
one
thing
at
least
was
obvious
she
was
not
made
to
be
looked
at
thus
the
reddleman
had
appeared
conscious
of
as
much
and
while
mrs
yeobright
looked
in
upon
her
he
cast
his
eyes
aside
with
a
delicacy
which
well
became
him
the
sleeper
apparently
thought
so
too
for
the
next
moment
she
opened
her
own
the
lips
then
parted
with
something
of
anticipation
something
more
of
doubt
and
her
several
thoughts
and
fractions
of
thoughts
as
signalled
by
the
changes
on
her
face
were
exhibited
by
the
light
to
the
utmost
nicety
an
ingenuous
transparent
life
was
disclosed
as
if
the
flow
of
her
existence
could
be
seen
passing
within
her
she
understood
the
scene
in
a
moment
o
yes
it
is
i
aunt
she
cried
i
know
how
frightened
you
are
and
how
you
cannot
believe
it
but
all
the
same
it
is
i
who
have
come
home
like
this
tamsin
tamsin
said
mrs
yeobright
stooping
over
the
young
woman
and
kissing
her
o
my
dear
girl
thomasin
was
now
on
the
verge
of
a
sob
but
by
an
unexpected
self
command
she
uttered
no
sound
with
a
gentle
panting
breath
she
sat
upright
i
did
not
expect
to
see
you
in
this
state
any
more
than
you
me
she
went
on
quickly
where
am
i
aunt
nearly
home
my
dear
in
egdon
bottom
what
dreadful
thing
is
it
i
ll
tell
you
in
a
moment
so
near
are
we
then
i
will
get
out
and
walk
i
want
to
go
home
by
the
path
but
this
kind
man
who
has
done
so
much
will
i
am
sure
take
you
right
on
to
my
house
said
the
aunt
turning
to
the
reddleman
who
had
withdrawn
from
the
front
of
the
van
on
the
awakening
of
the
girl
and
stood
in
the
road
why
should
you
think
it
necessary
to
ask
me
i
will
of
course
said
he
he
is
indeed
kind
murmured
thomasin
i
was
once
acquainted
with
him
aunt
and
when
i
saw
him
today
i
thought
i
should
prefer
his
van
to
any
conveyance
of
a
stranger
but
i
ll
walk
now
reddleman
stop
the
horses
please
the
man
regarded
her
with
tender
reluctance
but
stopped
them
aunt
and
niece
then
descended
from
the
van
mrs
yeobright
saying
to
its
owner
i
quite
recognize
you
now
what
made
you
change
from
the
nice
business
your
father
left
you
well
i
did
he
said
and
looked
at
thomasin
who
blushed
a
little
then
you
ll
not
be
wanting
me
any
more
tonight
ma
am
mrs
yeobright
glanced
around
at
the
dark
sky
at
the
hills
at
the
perishing
bonfires
and
at
the
lighted
window
of
the
inn
they
had
neared
i
think
not
she
said
since
thomasin
wishes
to
walk
we
can
soon
run
up
the
path
and
reach
home
we
know
it
well
and
after
a
few
further
words
they
parted
the
reddleman
moving
onwards
with
his
van
and
the
two
women
remaining
standing
in
the
road
as
soon
as
the
vehicle
and
its
driver
had
withdrawn
so
far
as
to
be
beyond
all
possible
reach
of
her
voice
mrs
yeobright
turned
to
her
niece
now
thomasin
she
said
sternly
what
s
the
meaning
of
this
disgraceful
performance
perplexity
among
honest
people
thomasin
looked
as
if
quite
overcome
by
her
aunt
s
change
of
manner
it
means
just
what
it
seems
to
mean
i
am
not
married
she
replied
faintly
excuse
me
for
humiliating
you
aunt
by
this
mishap
i
am
sorry
for
it
but
i
cannot
help
it
me
think
of
yourself
first
it
was
nobody
s
fault
when
we
got
there
the
parson
wouldn
t
marry
us
because
of
some
trifling
irregularity
in
the
license
what
irregularity
i
don
t
know
mr
wildeve
can
explain
i
did
not
think
when
i
went
away
this
morning
that
i
should
come
back
like
this
it
being
dark
thomasin
allowed
her
emotion
to
escape
her
by
the
silent
way
of
tears
which
could
roll
down
her
cheek
unseen
i
could
almost
say
that
it
serves
you
right
if
i
did
not
feel
that
you
don
t
deserve
it
continued
mrs
yeobright
who
possessing
two
distinct
moods
in
close
contiguity
a
gentle
mood
and
an
angry
flew
from
one
to
the
other
without
the
least
warning
remember
thomasin
this
business
was
none
of
my
seeking
from
the
very
first
when
you
began
to
feel
foolish
about
that
man
i
warned
you
he
would
not
make
you
happy
i
felt
it
so
strongly
that
i
did
what
i
would
never
have
believed
myself
capable
of
doing
stood
up
in
the
church
and
made
myself
the
public
talk
for
weeks
but
having
once
consented
i
don
t
submit
to
these
fancies
without
good
reason
marry
him
you
must
after
this
do
you
think
i
wish
to
do
otherwise
for
one
moment
said
thomasin
with
a
heavy
sigh
i
know
how
wrong
it
was
of
me
to
love
him
but
don
t
pain
me
by
talking
like
that
aunt
you
would
not
have
had
me
stay
there
with
him
would
you
and
your
house
is
the
only
home
i
have
to
return
to
he
says
we
can
be
married
in
a
day
or
two
i
wish
he
had
never
seen
you
very
well
then
i
will
be
the
miserablest
woman
in
the
world
and
not
let
him
see
me
again
no
i
won
t
have
him
it
is
too
late
to
speak
so
come
with
me
i
am
going
to
the
inn
to
see
if
he
has
returned
of
course
i
shall
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
story
at
once
mr
wildeve
must
not
suppose
he
can
play
tricks
upon
me
or
any
belonging
to
me
it
was
not
that
the
license
was
wrong
and
he
couldn
t
get
another
the
same
day
he
will
tell
you
in
a
moment
how
it
was
if
he
comes
why
didn
t
he
bring
you
back
that
was
me
again
sobbed
thomasin
when
i
found
we
could
not
be
married
i
didn
t
like
to
come
back
with
him
and
i
was
very
ill
then
i
saw
diggory
venn
and
was
glad
to
get
him
to
take
me
home
i
cannot
explain
it
any
better
and
you
must
be
angry
with
me
if
you
will
i
shall
see
about
that
said
mrs
yeobright
and
they
turned
towards
the
inn
known
in
the
neighbourhood
as
the
quiet
woman
the
sign
of
which
represented
the
figure
of
a
matron
carrying
her
head
under
her
arm
beneath
which
gruesome
design
was
written
the
couplet
so
well
known
to
frequenters
of
the
inn
since
the
woman
s
quiet
let
no
man
breed
a
riot
the
inn
which
really
bore
this
sign
and
legend
stood
some
miles
to
the
northwest
of
the
present
scene
wherein
the
house
more
immediately
referred
to
is
now
no
longer
an
inn
and
the
surroundings
are
much
changed
but
another
inn
some
of
whose
features
are
also
embodied
in
this
description
the
red
lion
at
winfrith
still
remains
as
a
haven
for
the
wayfarer
the
front
of
the
house
was
towards
the
heath
and
rainbarrow
whose
dark
shape
seemed
to
threaten
it
from
the
sky
upon
the
door
was
a
neglected
brass
plate
bearing
the
unexpected
inscription
mr
wildeve
engineer
a
useless
yet
cherished
relic
from
the
time
when
he
had
been
started
in
that
profession
in
an
office
at
budmouth
by
those
who
had
hoped
much
from
him
and
had
been
disappointed
the
garden
was
at
the
back
and
behind
this
ran
a
still
deep
stream
forming
the
margin
of
the
heath
in
that
direction
meadow
land
appearing
beyond
the
stream
but
the
thick
obscurity
permitted
only
skylines
to
be
visible
of
any
scene
at
present
the
water
at
the
back
of
the
house
could
be
heard
idly
spinning
whirpools
in
its
creep
between
the
rows
of
dry
feather
headed
reeds
which
formed
a
stockade
along
each
bank
their
presence
was
denoted
by
sounds
as
of
a
congregation
praying
humbly
produced
by
their
rubbing
against
each
other
in
the
slow
wind
the
window
whence
the
candlelight
had
shone
up
the
vale
to
the
eyes
of
the
bonfire
group
was
uncurtained
but
the
sill
lay
too
high
for
a
pedestrian
on
the
outside
to
look
over
it
into
the
room
a
vast
shadow
in
which
could
be
dimly
traced
portions
of
a
masculine
contour
blotted
half
the
ceiling
he
seems
to
be
at
home
said
mrs
yeobright
must
i
come
in
too
aunt
asked
thomasin
faintly
i
suppose
not
it
would
be
wrong
you
must
come
certainly
to
confront
him
so
that
he
may
make
no
false
representations
to
me
we
shall
not
be
five
minutes
in
the
house
and
then
we
ll
walk
home
entering
the
open
passage
she
tapped
at
the
door
of
the
private
parlour
unfastened
it
and
looked
in
the
back
and
shoulders
of
a
man
came
between
mrs
yeobright
s
eyes
and
the
fire
wildeve
whose
form
it
was
immediately
turned
arose
and
advanced
to
meet
his
visitors
he
was
quite
a
young
man
and
of
the
two
properties
form
and
motion
the
latter
first
attracted
the
eye
in
him
the
grace
of
his
movement
was
singular
it
was
the
pantomimic
expression
of
a
lady
killing
career
next
came
into
notice
the
more
material
qualities
among
which
was
a
profuse
crop
of
hair
impending
over
the
top
of
his
face
lending
to
his
forehead
the
high
cornered
outline
of
an
early
gothic
shield
and
a
neck
which
was
smooth
and
round
as
a
cylinder
the
lower
half
of
his
figure
was
of
light
build
altogether
he
was
one
in
whom
no
man
would
have
seen
anything
to
admire
and
in
whom
no
woman
would
have
seen
anything
to
dislike
he
discerned
the
young
girl
s
form
in
the
passage
and
said
thomasin
then
has
reached
home
how
could
you
leave
me
in
that
way
darling
and
turning
to
mrs
yeobright
it
was
useless
to
argue
with
her
she
would
go
and
go
alone
but
what
s
the
meaning
of
it
all
demanded
mrs
yeobright
haughtily
take
a
seat
said
wildeve
placing
chairs
for
the
two
women
well
it
was
a
very
stupid
mistake
but
such
mistakes
will
happen
the
license
was
useless
at
anglebury
it
was
made
out
for
budmouth
but
as
i
didn
t
read
it
i
wasn
t
aware
of
that
but
you
had
been
staying
at
anglebury
no
i
had
been
at
budmouth
till
two
days
ago
and
that
was
where
i
had
intended
to
take
her
but
when
i
came
to
fetch
her
we
decided
upon
anglebury
forgetting
that
a
new
license
would
be
necessary
there
was
not
time
to
get
to
budmouth
afterwards
i
think
you
are
very
much
to
blame
said
mrs
yeobright
it
was
quite
my
fault
we
chose
anglebury
thomasin
pleaded
i
proposed
it
because
i
was
not
known
there
i
know
so
well
that
i
am
to
blame
that
you
need
not
remind
me
of
it
replied
wildeve
shortly
such
things
don
t
happen
for
nothing
said
the
aunt
it
is
a
great
slight
to
me
and
my
family
and
when
it
gets
known
there
will
be
a
very
unpleasant
time
for
us
how
can
she
look
her
friends
in
the
face
tomorrow
it
is
a
very
great
injury
and
one
i
cannot
easily
forgive
it
may
even
reflect
on
her
character
nonsense
said
wildeve
thomasin
s
large
eyes
had
flown
from
the
face
of
one
to
the
face
of
the
other
during
this
discussion
and
she
now
said
anxiously
will
you
allow
me
aunt
to
talk
it
over
alone
with
damon
for
five
minutes
will
you
damon
certainly
dear
said
wildeve
if
your
aunt
will
excuse
us
he
led
her
into
an
adjoining
room
leaving
mrs
yeobright
by
the
fire
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
and
the
door
closed
thomasin
said
turning
up
her
pale
tearful
face
to
him
it
is
killing
me
this
damon
i
did
not
mean
to
part
from
you
in
anger
at
anglebury
this
morning
but
i
was
frightened
and
hardly
knew
what
i
said
i
ve
not
let
aunt
know
how
much
i
suffered
today
and
it
is
so
hard
to
command
my
face
and
voice
and
to
smile
as
if
it
were
a
slight
thing
to
me
but
i
try
to
do
so
that
she
may
not
be
still
more
indignant
with
you
i
know
you
could
not
help
it
dear
whatever
aunt
may
think
she
is
very
unpleasant
yes
thomasin
murmured
and
i
suppose
i
seem
so
now
damon
what
do
you
mean
to
do
about
me
do
about
you
yes
those
who
don
t
like
you
whisper
things
which
at
moments
make
me
doubt
you
we
mean
to
marry
i
suppose
don
t
we
of
course
we
do
we
have
only
to
go
to
budmouth
on
monday
and
we
marry
at
once
then
do
let
us
go
o
damon
what
you
make
me
say
she
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
here
am
i
asking
you
to
marry
me
when
by
rights
you
ought
to
be
on
your
knees
imploring
me
your
cruel
mistress
not
to
refuse
you
and
saying
it
would
break
your
heart
if
i
did
i
used
to
think
it
would
be
pretty
and
sweet
like
that
but
how
different
yes
real
life
is
never
at
all
like
that
but
i
don
t
care
personally
if
it
never
takes
place
she
added
with
a
little
dignity
no
i
can
live
without
you
it
is
aunt
i
think
of
she
is
so
proud
and
thinks
so
much
of
her
family
respectability
that
she
will
be
cut
down
with
mortification
if
this
story
should
get
abroad
before
it
is
done
my
cousin
clym
too
will
be
much
wounded
then
he
will
be
very
unreasonable
in
fact
you
are
all
rather
unreasonable
thomasin
coloured
a
little
and
not
with
love
but
whatever
the
momentary
feeling
which
caused
that
flush
in
her
it
went
as
it
came
and
she
humbly
said
i
never
mean
to
be
if
i
can
help
it
i
merely
feel
that
you
have
my
aunt
to
some
extent
in
your
power
at
last
as
a
matter
of
justice
it
is
almost
due
to
me
said
wildeve
think
what
i
have
gone
through
to
win
her
consent
the
insult
that
it
is
to
any
man
to
have
the
banns
forbidden
the
double
insult
to
a
man
unlucky
enough
to
be
cursed
with
sensitiveness
and
blue
demons
and
heaven
knows
what
as
i
am
i
can
never
forget
those
banns
a
harsher
man
would
rejoice
now
in
the
power
i
have
of
turning
upon
your
aunt
by
going
no
further
in
the
business
she
looked
wistfully
at
him
with
her
sorrowful
eyes
as
he
said
those
words
and
her
aspect
showed
that
more
than
one
person
in
the
room
could
deplore
the
possession
of
sensitiveness
seeing
that
she
was
really
suffering
he
seemed
disturbed
and
added
this
is
merely
a
reflection
you
know
i
have
not
the
least
intention
to
refuse
to
complete
the
marriage
tamsie
mine
i
could
not
bear
it
you
could
not
i
know
said
the
fair
girl
brightening
you
who
cannot
bear
the
sight
of
pain
in
even
an
insect
or
any
disagreeable
sound
or
unpleasant
smell
even
will
not
long
cause
pain
to
me
and
mine
i
will
not
if
i
can
help
it
your
hand
upon
it
damon
he
carelessly
gave
her
his
hand
ah
by
my
crown
what
s
that
he
said
suddenly
there
fell
upon
their
ears
the
sound
of
numerous
voices
singing
in
front
of
the
house
among
these
two
made
themselves
prominent
by
their
peculiarity
one
was
a
very
strong
bass
the
other
a
wheezy
thin
piping
thomasin
recognized
them
as
belonging
to
timothy
fairway
and
grandfer
cantle
respectively
what
does
it
mean
it
is
not
skimmity
riding
i
hope
she
said
with
a
frightened
gaze
at
wildeve
of
course
not
no
it
is
that
the
heath
folk
have
come
to
sing
to
us
a
welcome
this
is
intolerable
he
began
pacing
about
the
men
outside
singing
cheerily
he
told
her
that
she
was
the
joy
of
his
life
and
if
she
d
con
sent
he
would
make
her
his
wife
she
could
not
refuse
him
to
church
so
they
went
young
will
was
forgot
and
young
sue
was
content
and
then
was
she
kiss
d
and
set
down
on
his
knee
no
man
in
the
world
was
so
lov
ing
as
he
mrs
yeobright
burst
in
from
the
outer
room
thomasin
thomasin
she
said
looking
indignantly
at
wildeve
here
s
a
pretty
exposure
let
us
escape
at
once
come
it
was
however
too
late
to
get
away
by
the
passage
a
rugged
knocking
had
begun
upon
the
door
of
the
front
room
wildeve
who
had
gone
to
the
window
came
back
stop
he
said
imperiously
putting
his
hand
upon
mrs
yeobright
s
arm
we
are
regularly
besieged
there
are
fifty
of
them
out
there
if
there
s
one
you
stay
in
this
room
with
thomasin
i
ll
go
out
and
face
them
you
must
stay
now
for
my
sake
till
they
are
gone
so
that
it
may
seem
as
if
all
was
right
come
tamsie
dear
don
t
go
making
a
scene
we
must
marry
after
this
that
you
can
see
as
well
as
i
sit
still
that
s
all
and
don
t
speak
much
i
ll
manage
them
blundering
fools
he
pressed
the
agitated
girl
into
a
seat
returned
to
the
outer
room
and
opened
the
door
immediately
outside
in
the
passage
appeared
grandfer
cantle
singing
in
concert
with
those
still
standing
in
front
of
the
house
he
came
into
the
room
and
nodded
abstractedly
to
wildeve
his
lips
still
parted
and
his
features
excruciatingly
strained
in
the
emission
of
the
chorus
this
being
ended
he
said
heartily
here
s
welcome
to
the
new
made
couple
and
god
bless
em
thank
you
said
wildeve
with
dry
resentment
his
face
as
gloomy
as
a
thunderstorm
at
the
grandfer
s
heels
now
came
the
rest
of
the
group
which
included
fairway
christian
sam
the
turf
cutter
humphrey
and
a
dozen
others
all
smiled
upon
wildeve
and
upon
his
tables
and
chairs
likewise
from
a
general
sense
of
friendliness
towards
the
articles
as
well
as
towards
their
owner
we
be
not
here
afore
mrs
yeobright
after
all
said
fairway
recognizing
the
matron
s
bonnet
through
the
glass
partition
which
divided
the
public
apartment
they
had
entered
from
the
room
where
the
women
sat
we
struck
down
across
d
ye
see
mr
wildeve
and
she
went
round
by
the
path
and
i
see
the
young
bride
s
little
head
said
grandfer
peeping
in
the
same
direction
and
discerning
thomasin
who
was
waiting
beside
her
aunt
in
a
miserable
and
awkward
way
not
quite
settled
in
yet
well
well
there
s
plenty
of
time
wildeve
made
no
reply
and
probably
feeling
that
the
sooner
he
treated
them
the
sooner
they
would
go
he
produced
a
stone
jar
which
threw
a
warm
halo
over
matters
at
once
that
s
a
drop
of
the
right
sort
i
can
see
said
grandfer
cantle
with
the
air
of
a
man
too
well
mannered
to
show
any
hurry
to
taste
it
yes
said
wildeve
tis
some
old
mead
i
hope
you
will
like
it
o
ay
replied
the
guests
in
the
hearty
tones
natural
when
the
words
demanded
by
politeness
coincide
with
those
of
deepest
feeling
there
isn
t
a
prettier
drink
under
the
sun
i
ll
take
my
oath
there
isn
t
added
grandfer
cantle
all
that
can
be
said
against
mead
is
that
tis
rather
heady
and
apt
to
lie
about
a
man
a
good
while
but
tomorrow
s
sunday
thank
god
i
feel
d
for
all
the
world
like
some
bold
soldier
after
i
had
had
some
once
said
christian
you
shall
feel
so
again
said
wildeve
with
condescension
cups
or
glasses
gentlemen
well
if
you
don
t
mind
we
ll
have
the
beaker
and
pass
en
round
tis
better
than
heling
it
out
in
dribbles
jown
the
slippery
glasses
said
grandfer
cantle
what
s
the
good
of
a
thing
that
you
can
t
put
down
in
the
ashes
to
warm
hey
neighbours
that
s
what
i
ask
right
grandfer
said
sam
and
the
mead
then
circulated
well
said
timothy
fairway
feeling
demands
upon
his
praise
in
some
form
or
other
tis
a
worthy
thing
to
be
married
mr
wildeve
and
the
woman
you
ve
got
is
a
dimant
so
says
i
yes
he
continued
to
grandfer
cantle
raising
his
voice
so
as
to
be
heard
through
the
partition
her
father
inclining
his
head
towards
the
inner
room
was
as
good
a
feller
as
ever
lived
he
always
had
his
great
indignation
ready
against
anything
underhand
is
that
very
dangerous
said
christian
and
there
were
few
in
these
parts
that
were
upsides
with
him
said
sam
whenever
a
club
walked
he
d
play
the
clarinet
in
the
band
that
marched
before
em
as
if
he
d
never
touched
anything
but
a
clarinet
all
his
life
and
then
when
they
got
to
church
door
he
d
throw
down
the
clarinet
mount
the
gallery
snatch
up
the
bass
viol
and
rozum
away
as
if
he
d
never
played
anything
but
a
bass
viol
folk
would
say
folk
that
knowed
what
a
true
stave
was
surely
surely
that
s
never
the
same
man
that
i
saw
handling
the
clarinet
so
masterly
by
now
i
can
mind
it
said
the
furze
cutter
twas
a
wonderful
thing
that
one
body
could
hold
it
all
and
never
mix
the
fingering
there
was
kingsbere
church
likewise
fairway
recommenced
as
one
opening
a
new
vein
of
the
same
mine
of
interest
wildeve
breathed
the
breath
of
one
intolerably
bored
and
glanced
through
the
partition
at
the
prisoners
he
used
to
walk
over
there
of
a
sunday
afternoon
to
visit
his
old
acquaintance
andrew
brown
the
first
clarinet
there
a
good
man
enough
but
rather
screechy
in
his
music
if
you
can
mind
a
was
and
neighbour
yeobright
would
take
andrey
s
place
for
some
part
of
the
service
to
let
andrey
have
a
bit
of
a
nap
as
any
friend
would
naturally
do
as
any
friend
would
said
grandfer
cantle
the
other
listeners
expressing
the
same
accord
by
the
shorter
way
of
nodding
their
heads
no
sooner
was
andrey
asleep
and
the
first
whiff
of
neighbour
yeobright
s
wind
had
got
inside
andrey
s
clarinet
than
everyone
in
church
feeled
in
a
moment
there
was
a
great
soul
among
em
all
heads
would
turn
and
they
d
say
ah
i
thought
twas
he
one
sunday
i
can
well
mind
a
bass
viol
day
that
time
and
yeobright
had
brought
his
own
twas
the
hundred
and
thirty
third
to
lydia
and
when
they
d
come
to
ran
down
his
beard
and
o
er
his
robes
its
costly
moisture
shed
neighbour
yeobright
who
had
just
warmed
to
his
work
drove
his
bow
into
them
strings
that
glorious
grand
that
he
e
en
a
most
sawed
the
bass
viol
into
two
pieces
every
winder
in
church
rattled
as
if
twere
a
thunderstorm
old
pa
son
williams
lifted
his
hands
in
his
great
holy
surplice
as
natural
as
if
he
d
been
in
common
clothes
and
seemed
to
say
hisself
o
for
such
a
man
in
our
parish
but
not
a
soul
in
kingsbere
could
hold
a
candle
to
yeobright
was
it
quite
safe
when
the
winder
shook
christian
inquired
he
received
no
answer
all
for
the
moment
sitting
rapt
in
admiration
of
the
performance
described
as
with
farinelli
s
singing
before
the
princesses
sheridan
s
renowned
begum
speech
and
other
such
examples
the
fortunate
condition
of
its
being
for
ever
lost
to
the
world
invested
the
deceased
mr
yeobright
s
tour
de
force
on
that
memorable
afternoon
with
a
cumulative
glory
which
comparative
criticism
had
that
been
possible
might
considerably
have
shorn
down
he
was
the
last
you
d
have
expected
to
drop
off
in
the
prime
of
life
said
humphrey
ah
well
he
was
looking
for
the
earth
some
months
afore
he
went
at
that
time
women
used
to
run
for
smocks
and
gown
pieces
at
greenhill
fair
and
my
wife
that
is
now
being
a
long
legged
slittering
maid
hardly
husband
high
went
with
the
rest
of
the
maidens
for
a
was
a
good
runner
afore
she
got
so
heavy
when
she
came
home
i
said
we
were
then
just
beginning
to
walk
together
what
have
ye
got
my
honey
i
ve
won
well
i
ve
won
a
gown
piece
says
she
her
colours
coming
up
in
a
moment
tis
a
smock
for
a
crown
i
thought
and
so
it
turned
out
ay
when
i
think
what
she
ll
say
to
me
now
without
a
mossel
of
red
in
her
face
it
do
seem
strange
that
a
wouldn
t
say
such
a
little
thing
then
however
then
she
went
on
and
that
s
what
made
me
bring
up
the
story
well
whatever
clothes
i
ve
won
white
or
figured
for
eyes
to
see
or
for
eyes
not
to
see
a
could
do
a
pretty
stroke
of
modesty
in
those
days
i
d
sooner
have
lost
it
than
have
seen
what
i
have
poor
mr
yeobright
was
took
bad
directly
he
reached
the
fair
ground
and
was
forced
to
go
home
again
that
was
the
last
time
he
ever
went
out
of
the
parish
a
faltered
on
from
one
day
to
another
and
then
we
heard
he
was
gone
d
ye
think
he
had
great
pain
when
a
died
said
christian
o
no
quite
different
nor
any
pain
of
mind
he
was
lucky
enough
to
be
god
a
mighty
s
own
man
and
other
folk
d
ye
think
twill
be
much
pain
to
em
mister
fairway
that
depends
on
whether
they
be
afeard
i
bain
t
afeard
at
all
i
thank
god
said
christian
strenuously
i
m
glad
i
bain
t
for
then
twon
t
pain
me
i
don
t
think
i
be
afeard
or
if
i
be
i
can
t
help
it
and
i
don
t
deserve
to
suffer
i
wish
i
was
not
afeard
at
all
there
was
a
solemn
silence
and
looking
from
the
window
which
was
unshuttered
and
unblinded
timothy
said
well
what
a
fess
little
bonfire
that
one
is
out
by
cap
n
vye
s
tis
burning
just
the
same
now
as
ever
upon
my
life
all
glances
went
through
the
window
and
nobody
noticed
that
wildeve
disguised
a
brief
telltale
look
far
away
up
the
sombre
valley
of
heath
and
to
the
right
of
rainbarrow
could
indeed
be
seen
the
light
small
but
steady
and
persistent
as
before
it
was
lighted
before
ours
was
fairway
continued
and
yet
every
one
in
the
country
round
is
out
afore
n
perhaps
there
s
meaning
in
it
murmured
christian
how
meaning
said
wildeve
sharply
christian
was
too
scattered
to
reply
and
timothy
helped
him
he
means
sir
that
the
lonesome
dark
eyed
creature
up
there
that
some
say
is
a
witch
ever
i
should
call
a
fine
young
woman
such
a
name
is
always
up
to
some
odd
conceit
or
other
and
so
perhaps
tis
she
i
d
be
very
glad
to
ask
her
in
wedlock
if
she
d
hae
me
and
take
the
risk
of
her
wild
dark
eyes
ill
wishing
me
said
grandfer
cantle
staunchly
don
t
ye
say
it
father
implored
christian
well
be
dazed
if
he
who
do
marry
the
maid
won
t
hae
an
uncommon
picture
for
his
best
parlour
said
fairway
in
a
liquid
tone
placing
down
the
cup
of
mead
at
the
end
of
a
good
pull
and
a
partner
as
deep
as
the
north
star
said
sam
taking
up
the
cup
and
finishing
the
little
that
remained
well
really
now
i
think
we
must
be
moving
said
humphrey
observing
the
emptiness
of
the
vessel
but
we
ll
gie
em
another
song
said
grandfer
cantle
i
m
as
full
of
notes
as
a
bird
thank
you
grandfer
said
wildeve
but
we
will
not
trouble
you
now
some
other
day
must
do
for
that
when
i
have
a
party
be
jown
d
if
i
don
t
learn
ten
new
songs
for
t
or
i
won
t
learn
a
line
said
grandfer
cantle
and
you
may
be
sure
i
won
t
disappoint
ye
by
biding
away
mr
wildeve
i
quite
believe
you
said
that
gentleman
all
then
took
their
leave
wishing
their
entertainer
long
life
and
happiness
as
a
married
man
with
recapitulations
which
occupied
some
time
wildeve
attended
them
to
the
door
beyond
which
the
deep
dyed
upward
stretch
of
heath
stood
awaiting
them
an
amplitude
of
darkness
reigning
from
their
feet
almost
to
the
zenith
where
a
definite
form
first
became
visible
in
the
lowering
forehead
of
rainbarrow
diving
into
the
dense
obscurity
in
a
line
headed
by
sam
the
turf
cutter
they
pursued
their
trackless
way
home
when
the
scratching
of
the
furze
against
their
leggings
had
fainted
upon
the
ear
wildeve
returned
to
the
room
where
he
had
left
thomasin
and
her
aunt
the
women
were
gone
they
could
only
have
left
the
house
in
one
way
by
the
back
window
and
this
was
open
wildeve
laughed
to
himself
remained
a
moment
thinking
and
idly
returned
to
the
front
room
here
his
glance
fell
upon
a
bottle
of
wine
which
stood
on
the
mantelpiece
ah
old
dowden
he
murmured
and
going
to
the
kitchen
door
shouted
is
anybody
here
who
can
take
something
to
old
dowden
there
was
no
reply
the
room
was
empty
the
lad
who
acted
as
his
factotum
having
gone
to
bed
wildeve
came
back
put
on
his
hat
took
the
bottle
and
left
the
house
turning
the
key
in
the
door
for
there
was
no
guest
at
the
inn
tonight
as
soon
as
he
was
on
the
road
the
little
bonfire
on
mistover
knap
again
met
his
eye
still
waiting
are
you
my
lady
he
murmured
however
he
did
not
proceed
that
way
just
then
but
leaving
the
hill
to
the
left
of
him
he
stumbled
over
a
rutted
road
that
brought
him
to
a
cottage
which
like
all
other
habitations
on
the
heath
at
this
hour
was
only
saved
from
being
visible
by
a
faint
shine
from
its
bedroom
window
this
house
was
the
home
of
olly
dowden
the
besom
maker
and
he
entered
the
lower
room
was
in
darkness
but
by
feeling
his
way
he
found
a
table
whereon
he
placed
the
bottle
and
a
minute
later
emerged
again
upon
the
heath
he
stood
and
looked
northeast
at
the
undying
little
fire
high
up
above
him
though
not
so
high
as
rainbarrow
we
have
been
told
what
happens
when
a
woman
deliberates
and
the
epigram
is
not
always
terminable
with
woman
provided
that
one
be
in
the
case
and
that
a
fair
one
wildeve
stood
and
stood
longer
and
breathed
perplexedly
and
then
said
to
himself
with
resignation
yes
by
heaven
i
must
go
to
her
i
suppose
instead
of
turning
in
the
direction
of
home
he
pressed
on
rapidly
by
a
path
under
rainbarrow
towards
what
was
evidently
a
signal
light
the
figure
against
the
sky
when
the
whole
egdon
concourse
had
left
the
site
of
the
bonfire
to
its
accustomed
loneliness
a
closely
wrapped
female
figure
approached
the
barrow
from
that
quarter
of
the
heath
in
which
the
little
fire
lay
had
the
reddleman
been
watching
he
might
have
recognized
her
as
the
woman
who
had
first
stood
there
so
singularly
and
vanished
at
the
approach
of
strangers
she
ascended
to
her
old
position
at
the
top
where
the
red
coals
of
the
perishing
fire
greeted
her
like
living
eyes
in
the
corpse
of
day
there
she
stood
still
around
her
stretching
the
vast
night
atmosphere
whose
incomplete
darkness
in
comparison
with
the
total
darkness
of
the
heath
below
it
might
have
represented
a
venial
beside
a
mortal
sin
that
she
was
tall
and
straight
in
build
that
she
was
lady
like
in
her
movements
was
all
that
could
be
learnt
of
her
just
now
her
form
being
wrapped
in
a
shawl
folded
in
the
old
cornerwise
fashion
and
her
head
in
a
large
kerchief
a
protection
not
superfluous
at
this
hour
and
place
her
back
was
towards
the
wind
which
blew
from
the
northwest
but
whether
she
had
avoided
that
aspect
because
of
the
chilly
gusts
which
played
about
her
exceptional
position
or
because
her
interest
lay
in
the
southeast
did
not
at
first
appear
her
reason
for
standing
so
dead
still
as
the
pivot
of
this
circle
of
heath
country
was
just
as
obscure
her
extraordinary
fixity
her
conspicuous
loneliness
her
heedlessness
of
night
betokened
among
other
things
an
utter
absence
of
fear
a
tract
of
country
unaltered
from
that
sinister
condition
which
made
caesar
anxious
every
year
to
get
clear
of
its
glooms
before
the
autumnal
equinox
a
kind
of
landscape
and
weather
which
leads
travellers
from
the
south
to
describe
our
island
as
homer
s
cimmerian
land
was
not
on
the
face
of
it
friendly
to
women
it
might
reasonably
have
been
supposed
that
she
was
listening
to
the
wind
which
rose
somewhat
as
the
night
advanced
and
laid
hold
of
the
attention
the
wind
indeed
seemed
made
for
the
scene
as
the
scene
seemed
made
for
the
hour
part
of
its
tone
was
quite
special
what
was
heard
there
could
be
heard
nowhere
else
gusts
in
innumerable
series
followed
each
other
from
the
northwest
and
when
each
one
of
them
raced
past
the
sound
of
its
progress
resolved
into
three
treble
tenor
and
bass
notes
were
to
be
found
therein
the
general
ricochet
of
the
whole
over
pits
and
prominences
had
the
gravest
pitch
of
the
chime
next
there
could
be
heard
the
baritone
buzz
of
a
holly
tree
below
these
in
force
above
them
in
pitch
a
dwindled
voice
strove
hard
at
a
husky
tune
which
was
the
peculiar
local
sound
alluded
to
thinner
and
less
immediately
traceable
than
the
other
two
it
was
far
more
impressive
than
either
in
it
lay
what
may
be
called
the
linguistic
peculiarity
of
the
heath
and
being
audible
nowhere
on
earth
off
a
heath
it
afforded
a
shadow
of
reason
for
the
woman
s
tenseness
which
continued
as
unbroken
as
ever
throughout
the
blowing
of
these
plaintive
november
winds
that
note
bore
a
great
resemblance
to
the
ruins
of
human
song
which
remain
to
the
throat
of
fourscore
and
ten
it
was
a
worn
whisper
dry
and
papery
and
it
brushed
so
distinctly
across
the
ear
that
by
the
accustomed
the
material
minutiae
in
which
it
originated
could
be
realized
as
by
touch
it
was
the
united
products
of
infinitesimal
vegetable
causes
and
these
were
neither
stems
leaves
fruit
blades
prickles
lichen
nor
moss
they
were
the
mummied
heathbells
of
the
past
summer
originally
tender
and
purple
now
washed
colourless
by
michaelmas
rains
and
dried
to
dead
skins
by
october
suns
so
low
was
an
individual
sound
from
these
that
a
combination
of
hundreds
only
just
emerged
from
silence
and
the
myriads
of
the
whole
declivity
reached
the
woman
s
ear
but
as
a
shrivelled
and
intermittent
recitative
yet
scarcely
a
single
accent
among
the
many
afloat
tonight
could
have
such
power
to
impress
a
listener
with
thoughts
of
its
origin
one
inwardly
saw
the
infinity
of
those
combined
multitudes
and
perceived
that
each
of
the
tiny
trumpets
was
seized
on
entered
scoured
and
emerged
from
by
the
wind
as
thoroughly
as
if
it
were
as
vast
as
a
crater
the
spirit
moved
them
a
meaning
of
the
phrase
forced
itself
upon
the
attention
and
an
emotional
listener
s
fetichistic
mood
might
have
ended
in
one
of
more
advanced
quality
it
was
not
after
all
that
the
left
hand
expanse
of
old
blooms
spoke
or
the
right
hand
or
those
of
the
slope
in
front
but
it
was
the
single
person
of
something
else
speaking
through
each
at
once
suddenly
on
the
barrow
there
mingled
with
all
this
wild
rhetoric
of
night
a
sound
which
modulated
so
naturally
into
the
rest
that
its
beginning
and
ending
were
hardly
to
be
distinguished
the
bluffs
and
the
bushes
and
the
heather
bells
had
broken
silence
at
last
so
did
the
woman
and
her
articulation
was
but
as
another
phrase
of
the
same
discourse
as
theirs
thrown
out
on
the
winds
it
became
twined
in
with
them
and
with
them
it
flew
away
what
she
uttered
was
a
lengthened
sighing
apparently
at
something
in
her
mind
which
had
led
to
her
presence
here
there
was
a
spasmodic
abandonment
about
it
as
if
in
allowing
herself
to
utter
the
sound
the
woman
s
brain
had
authorized
what
it
could
not
regulate
one
point
was
evident
in
this
that
she
had
been
existing
in
a
suppressed
state
and
not
in
one
of
languor
or
stagnation
far
away
down
the
valley
the
faint
shine
from
the
window
of
the
inn
still
lasted
on
and
a
few
additional
moments
proved
that
the
window
or
what
was
within
it
had
more
to
do
with
the
woman
s
sigh
than
had
either
her
own
actions
or
the
scene
immediately
around
she
lifted
her
left
hand
which
held
a
closed
telescope
this
she
rapidly
extended
as
if
she
were
well
accustomed
to
the
operation
and
raising
it
to
her
eye
directed
it
towards
the
light
beaming
from
the
inn
the
handkerchief
which
had
hooded
her
head
was
now
a
little
thrown
back
her
face
being
somewhat
elevated
a
profile
was
visible
against
the
dull
monochrome
of
cloud
around
her
and
it
was
as
though
side
shadows
from
the
features
of
sappho
and
mrs
siddons
had
converged
upwards
from
the
tomb
to
form
an
image
like
neither
but
suggesting
both
this
however
was
mere
superficiality
in
respect
of
character
a
face
may
make
certain
admissions
by
its
outline
but
it
fully
confesses
only
in
its
changes
so
much
is
this
the
case
that
what
is
called
the
play
of
the
features
often
helps
more
in
understanding
a
man
or
woman
than
the
earnest
labours
of
all
the
other
members
together
thus
the
night
revealed
little
of
her
whose
form
it
was
embracing
for
the
mobile
parts
of
her
countenance
could
not
be
seen
at
last
she
gave
up
her
spying
attitude
closed
the
telescope
and
turned
to
the
decaying
embers
from
these
no
appreciable
beams
now
radiated
except
when
a
more
than
usually
smart
gust
brushed
over
their
faces
and
raised
a
fitful
glow
which
came
and
went
like
the
blush
of
a
girl
she
stooped
over
the
silent
circle
and
selecting
from
the
brands
a
piece
of
stick
which
bore
the
largest
live
coal
at
its
end
brought
it
to
where
she
had
been
standing
before
she
held
the
brand
to
the
ground
blowing
the
red
coal
with
her
mouth
at
the
same
time
till
it
faintly
illuminated
the
sod
and
revealed
a
small
object
which
turned
out
to
be
an
hourglass
though
she
wore
a
watch
she
blew
long
enough
to
show
that
the
sand
had
all
slipped
through
ah
she
said
as
if
surprised
the
light
raised
by
her
breath
had
been
very
fitful
and
a
momentary
irradiation
of
flesh
was
all
that
it
had
disclosed
of
her
face
that
consisted
of
two
matchless
lips
and
a
cheek
only
her
head
being
still
enveloped
she
threw
away
the
stick
took
the
glass
in
her
hand
the
telescope
under
her
arm
and
moved
on
along
the
ridge
ran
a
faint
foot
track
which
the
lady
followed
those
who
knew
it
well
called
it
a
path
and
while
a
mere
visitor
would
have
passed
it
unnoticed
even
by
day
the
regular
haunters
of
the
heath
were
at
no
loss
for
it
at
midnight
the
whole
secret
of
following
these
incipient
paths
when
there
was
not
light
enough
in
the
atmosphere
to
show
a
turnpike
road
lay
in
the
development
of
the
sense
of
touch
in
the
feet
which
comes
with
years
of
night
rambling
in
little
trodden
spots
to
a
walker
practised
in
such
places
a
difference
between
impact
on
maiden
herbage
and
on
the
crippled
stalks
of
a
slight
footway
is
perceptible
through
the
thickest
boot
or
shoe
the
solitary
figure
who
walked
this
beat
took
no
notice
of
the
windy
tune
still
played
on
the
dead
heathbells
she
did
not
turn
her
head
to
look
at
a
group
of
dark
creatures
further
on
who
fled
from
her
presence
as
she
skirted
a
ravine
where
they
fed
they
were
about
a
score
of
the
small
wild
ponies
known
as
heath
croppers
they
roamed
at
large
on
the
undulations
of
egdon
but
in
numbers
too
few
to
detract
much
from
the
solitude
the
pedestrian
noticed
nothing
just
now
and
a
clue
to
her
abstraction
was
afforded
by
a
trivial
incident
a
bramble
caught
hold
of
her
skirt
and
checked
her
progress
instead
of
putting
it
off
and
hastening
along
she
yielded
herself
up
to
the
pull
and
stood
passively
still
when
she
began
to
extricate
herself
it
was
by
turning
round
and
round
and
so
unwinding
the
prickly
switch
she
was
in
a
desponding
reverie
her
course
was
in
the
direction
of
the
small
undying
fire
which
had
drawn
the
attention
of
the
men
on
rainbarrow
and
of
wildeve
in
the
valley
below
a
faint
illumination
from
its
rays
began
to
glow
upon
her
face
and
the
fire
soon
revealed
itself
to
be
lit
not
on
the
level
ground
but
on
a
salient
corner
or
redan
of
earth
at
the
junction
of
two
converging
bank
fences
outside
was
a
ditch
dry
except
immediately
under
the
fire
where
there
was
a
large
pool
bearded
all
round
by
heather
and
rushes
in
the
smooth
water
of
the
pool
the
fire
appeared
upside
down
the
banks
meeting
behind
were
bare
of
a
hedge
save
such
as
was
formed
by
disconnected
tufts
of
furze
standing
upon
stems
along
the
top
like
impaled
heads
above
a
city
wall
a
white
mast
fitted
up
with
spars
and
other
nautical
tackle
could
be
seen
rising
against
the
dark
clouds
whenever
the
flames
played
brightly
enough
to
reach
it
altogether
the
scene
had
much
the
appearance
of
a
fortification
upon
which
had
been
kindled
a
beacon
fire
nobody
was
visible
but
ever
and
anon
a
whitish
something
moved
above
the
bank
from
behind
and
vanished
again
this
was
a
small
human
hand
in
the
act
of
lifting
pieces
of
fuel
into
the
fire
but
for
all
that
could
be
seen
the
hand
like
that
which
troubled
belshazzar
was
there
alone
occasionally
an
ember
rolled
off
the
bank
and
dropped
with
a
hiss
into
the
pool
at
one
side
of
the
pool
rough
steps
built
of
clods
enabled
everyone
who
wished
to
do
so
to
mount
the
bank
which
the
woman
did
within
was
a
paddock
in
an
uncultivated
state
though
bearing
evidence
of
having
once
been
tilled
but
the
heath
and
fern
had
insidiously
crept
in
and
were
reasserting
their
old
supremacy
further
ahead
were
dimly
visible
an
irregular
dwelling
house
garden
and
outbuildings
backed
by
a
clump
of
firs
the
young
lady
for
youth
had
revealed
its
presence
in
her
buoyant
bound
up
the
bank
walked
along
the
top
instead
of
descending
inside
and
came
to
the
corner
where
the
fire
was
burning
one
reason
for
the
permanence
of
the
blaze
was
now
manifest
the
fuel
consisted
of
hard
pieces
of
wood
cleft
and
sawn
the
knotty
boles
of
old
thorn
trees
which
grew
in
twos
and
threes
about
the
hillsides
a
yet
unconsumed
pile
of
these
lay
in
the
inner
angle
of
the
bank
and
from
this
corner
the
upturned
face
of
a
little
boy
greeted
her
eyes
he
was
dilatorily
throwing
up
a
piece
of
wood
into
the
fire
every
now
and
then
a
business
which
seemed
to
have
engaged
him
a
considerable
part
of
the
evening
for
his
face
was
somewhat
weary
i
am
glad
you
have
come
miss
eustacia
he
said
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
don
t
like
biding
by
myself
nonsense
i
have
only
been
a
little
way
for
a
walk
i
have
been
gone
only
twenty
minutes
it
seemed
long
murmured
the
sad
boy
and
you
have
been
so
many
times
why
i
thought
you
would
be
pleased
to
have
a
bonfire
are
you
not
much
obliged
to
me
for
making
you
one
yes
but
there
s
nobody
here
to
play
wi
me
i
suppose
nobody
has
come
while
i
ve
been
away
nobody
except
your
grandfather
he
looked
out
of
doors
once
for
ee
i
told
him
you
were
walking
round
upon
the
hill
to
look
at
the
other
bonfires
a
good
boy
i
think
i
hear
him
coming
again
miss
an
old
man
came
into
the
remoter
light
of
the
fire
from
the
direction
of
the
homestead
he
was
the
same
who
had
overtaken
the
reddleman
on
the
road
that
afternoon
he
looked
wistfully
to
the
top
of
the
bank
at
the
woman
who
stood
there
and
his
teeth
which
were
quite
unimpaired
showed
like
parian
from
his
parted
lips
when
are
you
coming
indoors
eustacia
he
asked
tis
almost
bedtime
i
ve
been
home
these
two
hours
and
am
tired
out
surely
tis
somewhat
childish
of
you
to
stay
out
playing
at
bonfires
so
long
and
wasting
such
fuel
my
precious
thorn
roots
the
rarest
of
all
firing
that
i
laid
by
on
purpose
for
christmas
you
have
burnt
em
nearly
all
i
promised
johnny
a
bonfire
and
it
pleases
him
not
to
let
it
go
out
just
yet
said
eustacia
in
a
way
which
told
at
once
that
she
was
absolute
queen
here
grandfather
you
go
in
to
bed
i
shall
follow
you
soon
you
like
the
fire
don
t
you
johnny
the
boy
looked
up
doubtfully
at
her
and
murmured
i
don
t
think
i
want
it
any
longer
her
grandfather
had
turned
back
again
and
did
not
hear
the
boy
s
reply
as
soon
as
the
white
haired
man
had
vanished
she
said
in
a
tone
of
pique
to
the
child
ungrateful
little
boy
how
can
you
contradict
me
never
shall
you
have
a
bonfire
again
unless
you
keep
it
up
now
come
tell
me
you
like
to
do
things
for
me
and
don
t
deny
it
the
repressed
child
said
yes
i
do
miss
and
continued
to
stir
the
fire
perfunctorily
stay
a
little
longer
and
i
will
give
you
a
crooked
six
pence
said
eustacia
more
gently
put
in
one
piece
of
wood
every
two
or
three
minutes
but
not
too
much
at
once
i
am
going
to
walk
along
the
ridge
a
little
longer
but
i
shall
keep
on
coming
to
you
and
if
you
hear
a
frog
jump
into
the
pond
with
a
flounce
like
a
stone
thrown
in
be
sure
you
run
and
tell
me
because
it
is
a
sign
of
rain
yes
eustacia
miss
vye
sir
miss
vy
stacia
that
will
do
now
put
in
one
stick
more
the
little
slave
went
on
feeding
the
fire
as
before
he
seemed
a
mere
automaton
galvanized
into
moving
and
speaking
by
the
wayward
eustacia
s
will
he
might
have
been
the
brass
statue
which
albertus
magnus
is
said
to
have
animated
just
so
far
as
to
make
it
chatter
and
move
and
be
his
servant
before
going
on
her
walk
again
the
young
girl
stood
still
on
the
bank
for
a
few
instants
and
listened
it
was
to
the
full
as
lonely
a
place
as
rainbarrow
though
at
rather
a
lower
level
and
it
was
more
sheltered
from
wind
and
weather
on
account
of
the
few
firs
to
the
north
the
bank
which
enclosed
the
homestead
and
protected
it
from
the
lawless
state
of
the
world
without
was
formed
of
thick
square
clods
dug
from
the
ditch
on
the
outside
and
built
up
with
a
slight
batter
or
incline
which
forms
no
slight
defense
where
hedges
will
not
grow
because
of
the
wind
and
the
wilderness
and
where
wall
materials
are
unattainable
otherwise
the
situation
was
quite
open
commanding
the
whole
length
of
the
valley
which
reached
to
the
river
behind
wildeve
s
house
high
above
this
to
the
right
and
much
nearer
thitherward
than
the
quiet
woman
inn
the
blurred
contour
of
rainbarrow
obstructed
the
sky
after
her
attentive
survey
of
the
wild
slopes
and
hollow
ravines
a
gesture
of
impatience
escaped
eustacia
she
vented
petulant
words
every
now
and
then
but
there
were
sighs
between
her
words
and
sudden
listenings
between
her
sighs
descending
from
her
perch
she
again
sauntered
off
towards
rainbarrow
though
this
time
she
did
not
go
the
whole
way
twice
she
reappeared
at
intervals
of
a
few
minutes
and
each
time
she
said
not
any
flounce
into
the
pond
yet
little
man
no
miss
eustacia
the
child
replied
well
she
said
at
last
i
shall
soon
be
going
in
and
then
i
will
give
you
the
crooked
sixpence
and
let
you
go
home
thank
ee
miss
eustacia
said
the
tired
stoker
breathing
more
easily
and
eustacia
again
strolled
away
from
the
fire
but
this
time
not
towards
rainbarrow
she
skirted
the
bank
and
went
round
to
the
wicket
before
the
house
where
she
stood
motionless
looking
at
the
scene
fifty
yards
off
rose
the
corner
of
the
two
converging
banks
with
the
fire
upon
it
within
the
bank
lifting
up
to
the
fire
one
stick
at
a
time
just
as
before
the
figure
of
the
little
child
she
idly
watched
him
as
he
occasionally
climbed
up
in
the
nook
of
the
bank
and
stood
beside
the
brands
the
wind
blew
the
smoke
and
the
child
s
hair
and
the
corner
of
his
pinafore
all
in
the
same
direction
the
breeze
died
and
the
pinafore
and
hair
lay
still
and
the
smoke
went
up
straight
while
eustacia
looked
on
from
this
distance
the
boy
s
form
visibly
started
he
slid
down
the
bank
and
ran
across
towards
the
white
gate
well
said
eustacia
a
hopfrog
have
jumped
into
the
pond
yes
i
heard
en
then
it
is
going
to
rain
and
you
had
better
go
home
you
will
not
be
afraid
she
spoke
hurriedly
as
if
her
heart
had
leapt
into
her
throat
at
the
boy
s
words
no
because
i
shall
hae
the
crooked
sixpence
yes
here
it
is
now
run
as
fast
as
you
can
not
that
way
through
the
garden
here
no
other
boy
in
the
heath
has
had
such
a
bonfire
as
yours
the
boy
who
clearly
had
had
too
much
of
a
good
thing
marched
away
into
the
shadows
with
alacrity
when
he
was
gone
eustacia
leaving
her
telescope
and
hourglass
by
the
gate
brushed
forward
from
the
wicket
towards
the
angle
of
the
bank
under
the
fire
here
screened
by
the
outwork
she
waited
in
a
few
moments
a
splash
was
audible
from
the
pond
outside
had
the
child
been
there
he
would
have
said
that
a
second
frog
had
jumped
in
but
by
most
people
the
sound
would
have
been
likened
to
the
fall
of
a
stone
into
the
water
eustacia
stepped
upon
the
bank
yes
she
said
and
held
her
breath
thereupon
the
contour
of
a
man
became
dimly
visible
against
the
low
reaching
sky
over
the
valley
beyond
the
outer
margin
of
the
pool
he
came
round
it
and
leapt
upon
the
bank
beside
her
a
low
laugh
escaped
her
the
third
utterance
which
the
girl
had
indulged
in
tonight
the
first
when
she
stood
upon
rainbarrow
had
expressed
anxiety
the
second
on
the
ridge
had
expressed
impatience
the
present
was
one
of
triumphant
pleasure
she
let
her
joyous
eyes
rest
upon
him
without
speaking
as
upon
some
wondrous
thing
she
had
created
out
of
chaos
i
have
come
said
the
man
who
was
wildeve
you
give
me
no
peace
why
do
you
not
leave
me
alone
i
have
seen
your
bonfire
all
the
evening
the
words
were
not
without
emotion
and
retained
their
level
tone
as
if
by
a
careful
equipoise
between
imminent
extremes
at
this
unexpectedly
repressing
manner
in
her
lover
the
girl
seemed
to
repress
herself
also
of
course
you
have
seen
my
fire
she
answered
with
languid
calmness
artificially
maintained
why
shouldn
t
i
have
a
bonfire
on
the
fifth
of
november
like
other
denizens
of
the
heath
i
knew
it
was
meant
for
me
how
did
you
know
it
i
have
had
no
word
with
you
since
you
you
chose
her
and
walked
about
with
her
and
deserted
me
entirely
as
if
i
had
never
been
yours
life
and
soul
so
irretrievably
eustacia
could
i
forget
that
last
autumn
at
this
same
day
of
the
month
and
at
this
same
place
you
lighted
exactly
such
a
fire
as
a
signal
for
me
to
come
and
see
you
why
should
there
have
been
a
bonfire
again
by
captain
vye
s
house
if
not
for
the
same
purpose
yes
yes
i
own
it
she
cried
under
her
breath
with
a
drowsy
fervour
of
manner
and
tone
which
was
quite
peculiar
to
her
don
t
begin
speaking
to
me
as
you
did
damon
you
will
drive
me
to
say
words
i
would
not
wish
to
say
to
you
i
had
given
you
up
and
resolved
not
to
think
of
you
any
more
and
then
i
heard
the
news
and
i
came
out
and
got
the
fire
ready
because
i
thought
that
you
had
been
faithful
to
me
what
have
you
heard
to
make
you
think
that
said
wildeve
astonished
that
you
did
not
marry
her
she
murmured
exultingly
and
i
knew
it
was
because
you
loved
me
best
and
couldn
t
do
it
damon
you
have
been
cruel
to
me
to
go
away
and
i
have
said
i
would
never
forgive
you
i
do
not
think
i
can
forgive
you
entirely
even
now
it
is
too
much
for
a
woman
of
any
spirit
to
quite
overlook
if
i
had
known
you
wished
to
call
me
up
here
only
to
reproach
me
i
wouldn
t
have
come
but
i
don
t
mind
it
and
i
do
forgive
you
now
that
you
have
not
married
her
and
have
come
back
to
me
who
told
you
that
i
had
not
married
her
my
grandfather
he
took
a
long
walk
today
and
as
he
was
coming
home
he
overtook
some
person
who
told
him
of
a
broken
off
wedding
he
thought
it
might
be
yours
and
i
knew
it
was
does
anybody
else
know
i
suppose
not
now
damon
do
you
see
why
i
lit
my
signal
fire
you
did
not
think
i
would
have
lit
it
if
i
had
imagined
you
to
have
become
the
husband
of
this
woman
it
is
insulting
my
pride
to
suppose
that
wildeve
was
silent
it
was
evident
that
he
had
supposed
as
much
did
you
indeed
think
i
believed
you
were
married
she
again
demanded
earnestly
then
you
wronged
me
and
upon
my
life
and
heart
i
can
hardly
bear
to
recognize
that
you
have
such
ill
thoughts
of
me
damon
you
are
not
worthy
of
me
i
see
it
and
yet
i
love
you
never
mind
let
it
go
i
must
bear
your
mean
opinion
as
best
i
may
it
is
true
is
it
not
she
added
with
ill
concealed
anxiety
on
his
making
no
demonstration
that
you
could
not
bring
yourself
to
give
me
up
and
are
still
going
to
love
me
best
of
all
yes
or
why
should
i
have
come
he
said
touchily
not
that
fidelity
will
be
any
great
merit
in
me
after
your
kind
speech
about
my
unworthiness
which
should
have
been
said
by
myself
if
by
anybody
and
comes
with
an
ill
grace
from
you
however
the
curse
of
inflammability
is
upon
me
and
i
must
live
under
it
and
take
any
snub
from
a
woman
it
has
brought
me
down
from
engineering
to
innkeeping
what
lower
stage
it
has
in
store
for
me
i
have
yet
to
learn
he
continued
to
look
upon
her
gloomily
she
seized
the
moment
and
throwing
back
the
shawl
so
that
the
firelight
shone
full
upon
her
face
and
throat
said
with
a
smile
have
you
seen
anything
better
than
that
in
your
travels
eustacia
was
not
one
to
commit
herself
to
such
a
position
without
good
ground
he
said
quietly
no
not
even
on
the
shoulders
of
thomasin
thomasin
is
a
pleasing
and
innocent
woman
that
s
nothing
to
do
with
it
she
cried
with
quick
passionateness
we
will
leave
her
out
there
are
only
you
and
me
now
to
think
of
after
a
long
look
at
him
she
resumed
with
the
old
quiescent
warmth
must
i
go
on
weakly
confessing
to
you
things
a
woman
ought
to
conceal
and
own
that
no
words
can
express
how
gloomy
i
have
been
because
of
that
dreadful
belief
i
held
till
two
hours
ago
that
you
had
quite
deserted
me
i
am
sorry
i
caused
you
that
pain
but
perhaps
it
is
not
wholly
because
of
you
that
i
get
gloomy
she
archly
added
it
is
in
my
nature
to
feel
like
that
it
was
born
in
my
blood
i
suppose
hypochondriasis
or
else
it
was
coming
into
this
wild
heath
i
was
happy
enough
at
budmouth
o
the
times
o
the
days
at
budmouth
but
egdon
will
be
brighter
again
now
i
hope
it
will
said
wildeve
moodily
do
you
know
the
consequence
of
this
recall
to
me
my
old
darling
i
shall
come
to
see
you
again
as
before
at
rainbarrow
of
course
you
will
and
yet
i
declare
that
until
i
got
here
tonight
i
intended
after
this
one
good
bye
never
to
meet
you
again
i
don
t
thank
you
for
that
she
said
turning
away
while
indignation
spread
through
her
like
subterranean
heat
you
may
come
again
to
rainbarrow
if
you
like
but
you
won
t
see
me
and
you
may
call
but
i
shall
not
listen
and
you
may
tempt
me
but
i
won
t
give
myself
to
you
any
more
you
have
said
as
much
before
sweet
but
such
natures
as
yours
don
t
so
easily
adhere
to
their
words
neither
for
the
matter
of
that
do
such
natures
as
mine
this
is
the
pleasure
i
have
won
by
my
trouble
she
whispered
bitterly
why
did
i
try
to
recall
you
damon
a
strange
warring
takes
place
in
my
mind
occasionally
i
think
when
i
become
calm
after
you
woundings
do
i
embrace
a
cloud
of
common
fog
after
all
you
are
a
chameleon
and
now
you
are
at
your
worst
colour
go
home
or
i
shall
hate
you
he
looked
absently
towards
rainbarrow
while
one
might
have
counted
twenty
and
said
as
if
he
did
not
much
mind
all
this
yes
i
will
go
home
do
you
mean
to
see
me
again
if
you
own
to
me
that
the
wedding
is
broken
off
because
you
love
me
best
i
don
t
think
it
would
be
good
policy
said
wildeve
smiling
you
would
get
to
know
the
extent
of
your
power
too
clearly
but
tell
me
you
know
where
is
she
now
i
don
t
know
i
prefer
not
to
speak
of
her
to
you
i
have
not
yet
married
her
i
have
come
in
obedience
to
your
call
that
is
enough
i
merely
lit
that
fire
because
i
was
dull
and
thought
i
would
get
a
little
excitement
by
calling
you
up
and
triumphing
over
you
as
the
witch
of
endor
called
up
samuel
i
determined
you
should
come
and
you
have
come
i
have
shown
my
power
a
mile
and
half
hither
and
a
mile
and
half
back
again
to
your
home
three
miles
in
the
dark
for
me
have
i
not
shown
my
power
he
shook
his
head
at
her
i
know
you
too
well
my
eustacia
i
know
you
too
well
there
isn
t
a
note
in
you
which
i
don
t
know
and
that
hot
little
bosom
couldn
t
play
such
a
cold
blooded
trick
to
save
its
life
i
saw
a
woman
on
rainbarrow
at
dusk
looking
down
towards
my
house
i
think
i
drew
out
you
before
you
drew
out
me
the
revived
embers
of
an
old
passion
glowed
clearly
in
wildeve
now
and
he
leant
forward
as
if
about
to
put
his
face
towards
her
cheek
o
no
she
said
intractably
moving
to
the
other
side
of
the
decayed
fire
what
did
you
mean
by
that
perhaps
i
may
kiss
your
hand
no
you
may
not
then
i
may
shake
your
hand
no
then
i
wish
you
good
night
without
caring
for
either
good
bye
good
bye
she
returned
no
answer
and
with
the
bow
of
a
dancing
master
he
vanished
on
the
other
side
of
the
pool
as
he
had
come
eustacia
sighed
it
was
no
fragile
maiden
sigh
but
a
sigh
which
shook
her
like
a
shiver
whenever
a
flash
of
reason
darted
like
an
electric
light
upon
her
lover
as
it
sometimes
would
and
showed
his
imperfections
she
shivered
thus
but
it
was
over
in
a
second
and
she
loved
on
she
knew
that
he
trifled
with
her
but
she
loved
on
she
scattered
the
half
burnt
brands
went
indoors
immediately
and
up
to
her
bedroom
without
a
light
amid
the
rustles
which
denoted
her
to
be
undressing
in
the
darkness
other
heavy
breaths
frequently
came
and
the
same
kind
of
shudder
occasionally
moved
through
her
when
ten
minutes
later
she
lay
on
her
bed
asleep
queen
of
night
eustacia
vye
was
the
raw
material
of
a
divinity
on
olympus
she
would
have
done
well
with
a
little
preparation
she
had
the
passions
and
instincts
which
make
a
model
goddess
that
is
those
which
make
not
quite
a
model
woman
had
it
been
possible
for
the
earth
and
mankind
to
be
entirely
in
her
grasp
for
a
while
she
had
handled
the
distaff
the
spindle
and
the
shears
at
her
own
free
will
few
in
the
world
would
have
noticed
the
change
of
government
there
would
have
been
the
same
inequality
of
lot
the
same
heaping
up
of
favours
here
of
contumely
there
the
same
generosity
before
justice
the
same
perpetual
dilemmas
the
same
captious
alteration
of
caresses
and
blows
that
we
endure
now
she
was
in
person
full
limbed
and
somewhat
heavy
without
ruddiness
as
without
pallor
and
soft
to
the
touch
as
a
cloud
to
see
her
hair
was
to
fancy
that
a
whole
winter
did
not
contain
darkness
enough
to
form
its
shadow
it
closed
over
her
forehead
like
nightfall
extinguishing
the
western
glow
her
nerves
extended
into
those
tresses
and
her
temper
could
always
be
softened
by
stroking
them
down
when
her
hair
was
brushed
she
would
instantly
sink
into
stillness
and
look
like
the
sphinx
if
in
passing
under
one
of
the
egdon
banks
any
of
its
thick
skeins
were
caught
as
they
sometimes
were
by
a
prickly
tuft
of
the
large
ulex
europoeus
which
will
act
as
a
sort
of
hairbrush
she
would
go
back
a
few
steps
and
pass
against
it
a
second
time
she
had
pagan
eyes
full
of
nocturnal
mysteries
and
their
light
as
it
came
and
went
and
came
again
was
partially
hampered
by
their
oppressive
lids
and
lashes
and
of
these
the
under
lid
was
much
fuller
than
it
usually
is
with
english
women
this
enabled
her
to
indulge
in
reverie
without
seeming
to
do
so
she
might
have
been
believed
capable
of
sleeping
without
closing
them
up
assuming
that
the
souls
of
men
and
women
were
visible
essences
you
could
fancy
the
colour
of
eustacia
s
soul
to
be
flamelike
the
sparks
from
it
that
rose
into
her
dark
pupils
gave
the
same
impression
the
mouth
seemed
formed
less
to
speak
than
to
quiver
less
to
quiver
than
to
kiss
some
might
have
added
less
to
kiss
than
to
curl
viewed
sideways
the
closing
line
of
her
lips
formed
with
almost
geometric
precision
the
curve
so
well
known
in
the
arts
of
design
as
the
cima
recta
or
ogee
the
sight
of
such
a
flexible
bend
as
that
on
grim
egdon
was
quite
an
apparition
it
was
felt
at
once
that
the
mouth
did
not
come
over
from
sleswig
with
a
band
of
saxon
pirates
whose
lips
met
like
the
two
halves
of
a
muffin
one
had
fancied
that
such
lip
curves
were
mostly
lurking
underground
in
the
south
as
fragments
of
forgotten
marbles
so
fine
were
the
lines
of
her
lips
that
though
full
each
corner
of
her
mouth
was
as
clearly
cut
as
the
point
of
a
spear
this
keenness
of
corner
was
only
blunted
when
she
was
given
over
to
sudden
fits
of
gloom
one
of
the
phases
of
the
night
side
of
sentiment
which
she
knew
too
well
for
her
years
her
presence
brought
memories
of
such
things
as
bourbon
roses
rubies
and
tropical
midnight
her
moods
recalled
lotus
eaters
and
the
march
in
athalie
her
motions
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
sea
her
voice
the
viola
in
a
dim
light
and
with
a
slight
rearrangement
of
her
hair
her
general
figure
might
have
stood
for
that
of
either
of
the
higher
female
deities
the
new
moon
behind
her
head
an
old
helmet
upon
it
a
diadem
of
accidental
dewdrops
round
her
brow
would
have
been
adjuncts
sufficient
to
strike
the
note
of
artemis
athena
or
hera
respectively
with
as
close
an
approximation
to
the
antique
as
that
which
passes
muster
on
many
respected
canvases
but
celestial
imperiousness
love
wrath
and
fervour
had
proved
to
be
somewhat
thrown
away
on
netherward
egdon
her
power
was
limited
and
the
consciousness
of
this
limitation
had
biassed
her
development
egdon
was
her
hades
and
since
coming
there
she
had
imbibed
much
of
what
was
dark
in
its
tone
though
inwardly
and
eternally
unreconciled
thereto
her
appearance
accorded
well
with
this
smouldering
rebelliousness
and
the
shady
splendour
of
her
beauty
was
the
real
surface
of
the
sad
and
stifled
warmth
within
her
a
true
tartarean
dignity
sat
upon
her
brow
and
not
factitiously
or
with
marks
of
constraint
for
it
had
grown
in
her
with
years
across
the
upper
part
of
her
head
she
wore
a
thin
fillet
of
black
velvet
restraining
the
luxuriance
of
her
shady
hair
in
a
way
which
added
much
to
this
class
of
majesty
by
irregularly
clouding
her
forehead
nothing
can
embellish
a
beautiful
face
more
than
a
narrow
band
drawn
over
the
brow
says
richter
some
of
the
neighbouring
girls
wore
coloured
ribbon
for
the
same
purpose
and
sported
metallic
ornaments
elsewhere
but
if
anyone
suggested
coloured
ribbon
and
metallic
ornaments
to
eustacia
vye
she
laughed
and
went
on
why
did
a
woman
of
this
sort
live
on
egdon
heath
budmouth
was
her
native
place
a
fashionable
seaside
resort
at
that
date
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
bandmaster
of
a
regiment
which
had
been
quartered
there
a
corfiote
by
birth
and
a
fine
musician
who
met
his
future
wife
during
her
trip
thither
with
her
father
the
captain
a
man
of
good
family
the
marriage
was
scarcely
in
accord
with
the
old
man
s
wishes
for
the
bandmaster
s
pockets
were
as
light
as
his
occupation
but
the
musician
did
his
best
adopted
his
wife
s
name
made
england
permanently
his
home
took
great
trouble
with
his
child
s
education
the
expenses
of
which
were
defrayed
by
the
grandfather
and
throve
as
the
chief
local
musician
till
her
mother
s
death
when
he
left
off
thriving
drank
and
died
also
the
girl
was
left
to
the
care
of
her
grandfather
who
since
three
of
his
ribs
became
broken
in
a
shipwreck
had
lived
in
this
airy
perch
on
egdon
a
spot
which
had
taken
his
fancy
because
the
house
was
to
be
had
for
next
to
nothing
and
because
a
remote
blue
tinge
on
the
horizon
between
the
hills
visible
from
the
cottage
door
was
traditionally
believed
to
be
the
english
channel
she
hated
the
change
she
felt
like
one
banished
but
here
she
was
forced
to
abide
thus
it
happened
that
in
eustacia
s
brain
were
juxtaposed
the
strangest
assortment
of
ideas
from
old
time
and
from
new
there
was
no
middle
distance
in
her
perspective
romantic
recollections
of
sunny
afternoons
on
an
esplanade
with
military
bands
officers
and
gallants
around
stood
like
gilded
letters
upon
the
dark
tablet
of
surrounding
egdon
every
bizarre
effect
that
could
result
from
the
random
intertwining
of
watering
place
glitter
with
the
grand
solemnity
of
a
heath
was
to
be
found
in
her
seeing
nothing
of
human
life
now
she
imagined
all
the
more
of
what
she
had
seen
where
did
her
dignity
come
from
by
a
latent
vein
from
alcinous
line
her
father
hailing
from
phaeacia
s
isle
or
from
fitzalan
and
de
vere
her
maternal
grandfather
having
had
a
cousin
in
the
peerage
perhaps
it
was
the
gift
of
heaven
a
happy
convergence
of
natural
laws
among
other
things
opportunity
had
of
late
years
been
denied
her
of
learning
to
be
undignified
for
she
lived
lonely
isolation
on
a
heath
renders
vulgarity
well
nigh
impossible
it
would
have
been
as
easy
for
the
heath
ponies
bats
and
snakes
to
be
vulgar
as
for
her
a
narrow
life
in
budmouth
might
have
completely
demeaned
her
the
only
way
to
look
queenly
without
realms
or
hearts
to
queen
it
over
is
to
look
as
if
you
had
lost
them
and
eustacia
did
that
to
a
triumph
in
the
captain
s
cottage
she
could
suggest
mansions
she
had
never
seen
perhaps
that
was
because
she
frequented
a
vaster
mansion
than
any
of
them
the
open
hills
like
the
summer
condition
of
the
place
around
her
she
was
an
embodiment
of
the
phrase
a
populous
solitude
apparently
so
listless
void
and
quiet
she
was
really
busy
and
full
to
be
loved
to
madness
such
was
her
great
desire
love
was
to
her
the
one
cordial
which
could
drive
away
the
eating
loneliness
of
her
days
and
she
seemed
to
long
for
the
abstraction
called
passionate
love
more
than
for
any
particular
lover
she
could
show
a
most
reproachful
look
at
times
but
it
was
directed
less
against
human
beings
than
against
certain
creatures
of
her
mind
the
chief
of
these
being
destiny
through
whose
interference
she
dimly
fancied
it
arose
that
love
alighted
only
on
gliding
youth
that
any
love
she
might
win
would
sink
simultaneously
with
the
sand
in
the
glass
she
thought
of
it
with
an
ever
growing
consciousness
of
cruelty
which
tended
to
breed
actions
of
reckless
unconventionality
framed
to
snatch
a
year
s
a
week
s
even
an
hour
s
passion
from
anywhere
while
it
could
be
won
through
want
of
it
she
had
sung
without
being
merry
possessed
without
enjoying
outshone
without
triumphing
her
loneliness
deepened
her
desire
on
egdon
coldest
and
meanest
kisses
were
at
famine
prices
and
where
was
a
mouth
matching
hers
to
be
found
fidelity
in
love
for
fidelity
s
sake
had
less
attraction
for
her
than
for
most
women
fidelity
because
of
love
s
grip
had
much
a
blaze
of
love
and
extinction
was
better
than
a
lantern
glimmer
of
the
same
which
should
last
long
years
on
this
head
she
knew
by
prevision
what
most
women
learn
only
by
experience
she
had
mentally
walked
round
love
told
the
towers
thereof
considered
its
palaces
and
concluded
that
love
was
but
a
doleful
joy
yet
she
desired
it
as
one
in
a
desert
would
be
thankful
for
brackish
water
she
often
repeated
her
prayers
not
at
particular
times
but
like
the
unaffectedly
devout
when
she
desired
to
pray
her
prayer
was
always
spontaneous
and
often
ran
thus
o
deliver
my
heart
from
this
fearful
gloom
and
loneliness
send
me
great
love
from
somewhere
else
i
shall
die
her
high
gods
were
william
the
conqueror
strafford
and
napoleon
buonaparte
as
they
had
appeared
in
the
lady
s
history
used
at
the
establishment
in
which
she
was
educated
had
she
been
a
mother
she
would
have
christened
her
boys
such
names
as
saul
or
sisera
in
preference
to
jacob
or
david
neither
of
whom
she
admired
at
school
she
had
used
to
side
with
the
philistines
in
several
battles
and
had
wondered
if
pontius
pilate
were
as
handsome
as
he
was
frank
and
fair
thus
she
was
a
girl
of
some
forwardness
of
mind
indeed
weighed
in
relation
to
her
situation
among
the
very
rearward
of
thinkers
very
original
her
instincts
towards
social
non
comformity
were
at
the
root
of
this
in
the
matter
of
holidays
her
mood
was
that
of
horses
who
when
turned
out
to
grass
enjoy
looking
upon
their
kind
at
work
on
the
highway
she
only
valued
rest
to
herself
when
it
came
in
the
midst
of
other
people
s
labour
hence
she
hated
sundays
when
all
was
at
rest
and
often
said
they
would
be
the
death
of
her
to
see
the
heathmen
in
their
sunday
condition
that
is
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
their
boots
newly
oiled
and
not
laced
up
a
particularly
sunday
sign
walking
leisurely
among
the
turves
and
furze
faggots
they
had
cut
during
the
week
and
kicking
them
critically
as
if
their
use
were
unknown
was
a
fearful
heaviness
to
her
to
relieve
the
tedium
of
this
untimely
day
she
would
overhaul
the
cupboards
containing
her
grandfather
s
old
charts
and
other
rubbish
humming
saturday
night
ballads
of
the
country
people
the
while
but
on
saturday
nights
she
would
frequently
sing
a
psalm
and
it
was
always
on
a
weekday
that
she
read
the
bible
that
she
might
be
unoppressed
with
a
sense
of
doing
her
duty
such
views
of
life
were
to
some
extent
the
natural
begettings
of
her
situation
upon
her
nature
to
dwell
on
a
heath
without
studying
its
meanings
was
like
wedding
a
foreigner
without
learning
his
tongue
the
subtle
beauties
of
the
heath
were
lost
to
eustacia
she
only
caught
its
vapours
an
environment
which
would
have
made
a
contented
woman
a
poet
a
suffering
woman
a
devotee
a
pious
woman
a
psalmist
even
a
giddy
woman
thoughtful
made
a
rebellious
woman
saturnine
eustacia
had
got
beyond
the
vision
of
some
marriage
of
inexpressible
glory
yet
though
her
emotions
were
in
full
vigour
she
cared
for
no
meaner
union
thus
we
see
her
in
a
strange
state
of
isolation
to
have
lost
the
godlike
conceit
that
we
may
do
what
we
will
and
not
to
have
acquired
a
homely
zest
for
doing
what
we
can
shows
a
grandeur
of
temper
which
cannot
be
objected
to
in
the
abstract
for
it
denotes
a
mind
that
though
disappointed
forswears
compromise
but
if
congenial
to
philosophy
it
is
apt
to
be
dangerous
to
the
commonwealth
in
a
world
where
doing
means
marrying
and
the
commonwealth
is
one
of
hearts
and
hands
the
same
peril
attends
the
condition
and
so
we
see
our
eustacia
for
at
times
she
was
not
altogether
unlovable
arriving
at
that
stage
of
enlightenment
which
feels
that
nothing
is
worth
while
and
filling
up
the
spare
hours
of
her
existence
by
idealizing
wildeve
for
want
of
a
better
object
this
was
the
sole
reason
of
his
ascendency
she
knew
it
herself
at
moments
her
pride
rebelled
against
her
passion
for
him
and
she
even
had
longed
to
be
free
but
there
was
only
one
circumstance
which
could
dislodge
him
and
that
was
the
advent
of
a
greater
man
for
the
rest
she
suffered
much
from
depression
of
spirits
and
took
slow
walks
to
recover
them
in
which
she
carried
her
grandfather
s
telescope
and
her
grandmother
s
hourglass
the
latter
because
of
a
peculiar
pleasure
she
derived
from
watching
a
material
representation
of
time
s
gradual
glide
away
she
seldom
schemed
but
when
she
did
scheme
her
plans
showed
rather
the
comprehensive
strategy
of
a
general
than
the
small
arts
called
womanish
though
she
could
utter
oracles
of
delphian
ambiguity
when
she
did
not
choose
to
be
direct
in
heaven
she
will
probably
sit
between
the
heloises
and
the
cleopatras
those
who
are
found
where
there
is
said
to
be
nobody
as
soon
as
the
sad
little
boy
had
withdrawn
from
the
fire
he
clasped
the
money
tight
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
as
if
thereby
to
fortify
his
courage
and
began
to
run
there
was
really
little
danger
in
allowing
a
child
to
go
home
alone
on
this
part
of
egdon
heath
the
distance
to
the
boy
s
house
was
not
more
than
three
eighths
of
a
mile
his
father
s
cottage
and
one
other
a
few
yards
further
on
forming
part
of
the
small
hamlet
of
mistover
knap
the
third
and
only
remaining
house
was
that
of
captain
vye
and
eustacia
which
stood
quite
away
from
the
small
cottages
and
was
the
loneliest
of
lonely
houses
on
these
thinly
populated
slopes
he
ran
until
he
was
out
of
breath
and
then
becoming
more
courageous
walked
leisurely
along
singing
in
an
old
voice
a
little
song
about
a
sailor
boy
and
a
fair
one
and
bright
gold
in
store
in
the
middle
of
this
the
child
stopped
from
a
pit
under
the
hill
ahead
of
him
shone
a
light
whence
proceeded
a
cloud
of
floating
dust
and
a
smacking
noise
only
unusual
sights
and
sounds
frightened
the
boy
the
shrivelled
voice
of
the
heath
did
not
alarm
him
for
that
was
familiar
the
thornbushes
which
arose
in
his
path
from
time
to
time
were
less
satisfactory
for
they
whistled
gloomily
and
had
a
ghastly
habit
after
dark
of
putting
on
the
shapes
of
jumping
madmen
sprawling
giants
and
hideous
cripples
lights
were
not
uncommon
this
evening
but
the
nature
of
all
of
them
was
different
from
this
discretion
rather
than
terror
prompted
the
boy
to
turn
back
instead
of
passing
the
light
with
a
view
of
asking
miss
eustacia
vye
to
let
her
servant
accompany
him
home
when
the
boy
had
reascended
to
the
top
of
the
valley
he
found
the
fire
to
be
still
burning
on
the
bank
though
lower
than
before
beside
it
instead
of
eustacia
s
solitary
form
he
saw
two
persons
the
second
being
a
man
the
boy
crept
along
under
the
bank
to
ascertain
from
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
if
it
would
be
prudent
to
interrupt
so
splendid
a
creature
as
miss
eustacia
on
his
poor
trivial
account
after
listening
under
the
bank
for
some
minutes
to
the
talk
he
turned
in
a
perplexed
and
doubting
manner
and
began
to
withdraw
as
silently
as
he
had
come
that
he
did
not
upon
the
whole
think
it
advisable
to
interrupt
her
conversation
with
wildeve
without
being
prepared
to
bear
the
whole
weight
of
her
displeasure
was
obvious
here
was
a
scyllaeo
charybdean
position
for
a
poor
boy
pausing
when
again
safe
from
discovery
he
finally
decided
to
face
the
pit
phenomenon
as
the
lesser
evil
with
a
heavy
sigh
he
retraced
the
slope
and
followed
the
path
he
had
followed
before
the
light
had
gone
the
rising
dust
had
disappeared
he
hoped
for
ever
he
marched
resolutely
along
and
found
nothing
to
alarm
him
till
coming
within
a
few
yards
of
the
sandpit
he
heard
a
slight
noise
in
front
which
led
him
to
halt
the
halt
was
but
momentary
for
the
noise
resolved
itself
into
the
steady
bites
of
two
animals
grazing
two
he
th
croppers
down
here
he
said
aloud
i
have
never
known
em
come
down
so
far
afore
the
animals
were
in
the
direct
line
of
his
path
but
that
the
child
thought
little
of
he
had
played
round
the
fetlocks
of
horses
from
his
infancy
on
coming
nearer
however
the
boy
was
somewhat
surprised
to
find
that
the
little
creatures
did
not
run
off
and
that
each
wore
a
clog
to
prevent
his
going
astray
this
signified
that
they
had
been
broken
in
he
could
now
see
the
interior
of
the
pit
which
being
in
the
side
of
the
hill
had
a
level
entrance
in
the
innermost
corner
the
square
outline
of
a
van
appeared
with
its
back
towards
him
a
light
came
from
the
interior
and
threw
a
moving
shadow
upon
the
vertical
face
of
gravel
at
the
further
side
of
the
pit
into
which
the
vehicle
faced
the
child
assumed
that
this
was
the
cart
of
a
gipsy
and
his
dread
of
those
wanderers
reached
but
to
that
mild
pitch
which
titillates
rather
than
pains
only
a
few
inches
of
mud
wall
kept
him
and
his
family
from
being
gipsies
themselves
he
skirted
the
gravel
pit
at
a
respectful
distance
ascended
the
slope
and
came
forward
upon
the
brow
in
order
to
look
into
the
open
door
of
the
van
and
see
the
original
of
the
shadow
the
picture
alarmed
the
boy
by
a
little
stove
inside
the
van
sat
a
figure
red
from
head
to
heels
the
man
who
had
been
thomasin
s
friend
he
was
darning
a
stocking
which
was
red
like
the
rest
of
him
moreover
as
he
darned
he
smoked
a
pipe
the
stem
and
bowl
of
which
were
red
also
at
this
moment
one
of
the
heath
croppers
feeding
in
the
outer
shadows
was
audibly
shaking
off
the
clog
attached
to
its
foot
aroused
by
the
sound
the
reddleman
laid
down
his
stocking
lit
a
lantern
which
hung
beside
him
and
came
out
from
the
van
in
sticking
up
the
candle
he
lifted
the
lantern
to
his
face
and
the
light
shone
into
the
whites
of
his
eyes
and
upon
his
ivory
teeth
which
in
contrast
with
the
red
surrounding
lent
him
a
startling
aspect
enough
to
the
gaze
of
a
juvenile
the
boy
knew
too
well
for
his
peace
of
mind
upon
whose
lair
he
had
lighted
uglier
persons
than
gipsies
were
known
to
cross
egdon
at
times
and
a
reddleman
was
one
of
them
how
i
wish
twas
only
a
gipsy
he
murmured
the
man
was
by
this
time
coming
back
from
the
horses
in
his
fear
of
being
seen
the
boy
rendered
detection
certain
by
nervous
motion
the
heather
and
peat
stratum
overhung
the
brow
of
the
pit
in
mats
hiding
the
actual
verge
the
boy
had
stepped
beyond
the
solid
ground
the
heather
now
gave
way
and
down
he
rolled
over
the
scarp
of
grey
sand
to
the
very
foot
of
the
man
the
red
man
opened
the
lantern
and
turned
it
upon
the
figure
of
the
prostrate
boy
who
be
ye
he
said
johnny
nunsuch
master

were
you
doing
up
there
i
don
t
know

sixpence

did
you
come
by
that
miss
vye
gied
it
to
me
for
keeping
up
her
bonfire
the
sixpence
was
found
and
the
man
went
to
the
van
the
boy
behind
almost
holding
his
breath
the
man
took
a
piece
of
rag
from
a
satchel
containing
sewing
materials
tore
off
a
strip
which
like
everything
else
was
tinged
red
and
proceeded
to
bind
up
the
wound

the
back
of

full
of
red
stuff
was

because

orchard
said
he
seed
a
red
ghost
here
t
other
day
perhaps
that
was
you
i
was
here
t
other
day
were
you
making
that
dusty
light
i
saw
by
now
oh
yes
i
was
beating
out
some
bags
and
have
you
had
a
good
bonfire
up
there
i
saw
the
light
why
did
miss
vye
want
a
bonfire
so
bad
that
she
should
give
you
sixpence
to
keep
it
up
i
don
t
know
i
was
tired
but
she
made
me
bide
and
keep
up
the
fire
just
the
same
while
she
kept
going
up
across
rainbarrow
way
and
how
long
did
that
last
until
a
hopfrog
jumped
into
the
pond
the
reddleman
suddenly
ceased
to
talk
idly
a
hopfrog
he
inquired
hopfrogs
don
t
jump
into
ponds
this
time
of
year
they
do
for
i
heard
one
certain
sure
yes
she
told
me
afore
that
i
should
hear
n
and
so
i
did
they
say
she
s
clever
and
deep
and
perhaps
she
charmed
en
to
come
and
what
then
then
i
came
down
here
and
i
was
afeard
and
i
went
back
but
i
didn
t
like
to
speak
to
her
because
of
the
gentleman
and
i
came
on
here
again
a
gentleman
ah
what
did
she
say
to
him
my
man
told
him
she
supposed
he
had
not
married
the
other
woman
because
he
liked
his
old
sweetheart
best
and
things
like
that
what
did
the
gentleman
say
to
her
my
sonny
he
only
said
he
did
like
her
best
and
how
he
was
coming
to
see
her
again
under
rainbarrow
o
nights
ha
cried
the
reddleman
slapping
his
hand
against
the
side
of
his
van
so
that
the
whole
fabric
shook
under
the
blow
that
s
the
secret
o
t
the
little
boy
jumped
clean
from
the
stool
my
man
don
t
you
be
afraid
said
the
dealer
in
red
suddenly
becoming
gentle
i
forgot
you
were
here
that
s
only
a
curious
way
reddlemen
have
of
going
mad
for
a
moment
but
they
don
t
hurt
anybody
and
what
did
the
lady
say
then
i
can
t
mind
please
master
reddleman
may
i
go
home
along
now
ay
to
be
sure
you
may
i
ll
go
a
bit
of
ways
with
you
he
conducted
the
boy
out
of
the
gravel
pit
and
into
the
path
leading
to
his
mother
s
cottage
when
the
little
figure
had
vanished
in
the
darkness
the
reddleman
returned
resumed
his
seat
by
the
fire
and
proceeded
to
darn
again
love
leads
a
shrewd
man
into
strategy
reddlemen
of
the
old
school
are
now
but
seldom
seen
since
the
introduction
of
railways
wessex
farmers
have
managed
to
do
without
these
mephistophelian
visitants
and
the
bright
pigment
so
largely
used
by
shepherds
in
preparing
sheep
for
the
fair
is
obtained
by
other
routes
even
those
who
yet
survive
are
losing
the
poetry
of
existence
which
characterized
them
when
the
pursuit
of
the
trade
meant
periodical
journeys
to
the
pit
whence
the
material
was
dug
a
regular
camping
out
from
month
to
month
except
in
the
depth
of
winter
a
peregrination
among
farms
which
could
be
counted
by
the
hundred
and
in
spite
of
this
arab
existence
the
preservation
of
that
respectability
which
is
insured
by
the
never
failing
production
of
a
well
lined
purse
reddle
spreads
its
lively
hues
over
everything
it
lights
on
and
stamps
unmistakably
as
with
the
mark
of
cain
any
person
who
has
handled
it
half
an
hour
a
child
s
first
sight
of
a
reddleman
was
an
epoch
in
his
life
that
blood
coloured
figure
was
a
sublimation
of
all
the
horrid
dreams
which
had
afflicted
the
juvenile
spirit
since
imagination
began
the
reddleman
is
coming
for
you
had
been
the
formulated
threat
of
wessex
mothers
for
many
generations
he
was
successfully
supplanted
for
a
while
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
by
buonaparte
but
as
process
of
time
rendered
the
latter
personage
stale
and
ineffective
the
older
phrase
resumed
its
early
prominence
and
now
the
reddleman
has
in
his
turn
followed
buonaparte
to
the
land
of
worn
out
bogeys
and
his
place
is
filled
by
modern
inventions
the
reddleman
lived
like
a
gipsy
but
gipsies
he
scorned
he
was
about
as
thriving
as
travelling
basket
and
mat
makers
but
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
them
he
was
more
decently
born
and
brought
up
than
the
cattledrovers
who
passed
and
repassed
him
in
his
wanderings
but
they
merely
nodded
to
him
his
stock
was
more
valuable
than
that
of
pedlars
but
they
did
not
think
so
and
passed
his
cart
with
eyes
straight
ahead
he
was
such
an
unnatural
colour
to
look
at
that
the
men
of
roundabouts
and
waxwork
shows
seemed
gentlemen
beside
him
but
he
considered
them
low
company
and
remained
aloof
among
all
these
squatters
and
folks
of
the
road
the
reddleman
continually
found
himself
yet
he
was
not
of
them
his
occupation
tended
to
isolate
him
and
isolated
he
was
mostly
seen
to
be
it
was
sometimes
suggested
that
reddlemen
were
criminals
for
whose
misdeeds
other
men
wrongfully
suffered
that
in
escaping
the
law
they
had
not
escaped
their
own
consciences
and
had
taken
to
the
trade
as
a
lifelong
penance
else
why
should
they
have
chosen
it
in
the
present
case
such
a
question
would
have
been
particularly
apposite
the
reddleman
who
had
entered
egdon
that
afternoon
was
an
instance
of
the
pleasing
being
wasted
to
form
the
ground
work
of
the
singular
when
an
ugly
foundation
would
have
done
just
as
well
for
that
purpose
the
one
point
that
was
forbidding
about
this
reddleman
was
his
colour
freed
from
that
he
would
have
been
as
agreeable
a
specimen
of
rustic
manhood
as
one
would
often
see
a
keen
observer
might
have
been
inclined
to
think
which
was
indeed
partly
the
truth
that
he
had
relinquished
his
proper
station
in
life
for
want
of
interest
in
it
moreover
after
looking
at
him
one
would
have
hazarded
the
guess
that
good
nature
and
an
acuteness
as
extreme
as
it
could
be
without
verging
on
craft
formed
the
framework
of
his
character
while
he
darned
the
stocking
his
face
became
rigid
with
thought
softer
expressions
followed
this
and
then
again
recurred
the
tender
sadness
which
had
sat
upon
him
during
his
drive
along
the
highway
that
afternoon
presently
his
needle
stopped
he
laid
down
the
stocking
arose
from
his
seat
and
took
a
leathern
pouch
from
a
hook
in
the
corner
of
the
van
this
contained
among
other
articles
a
brown
paper
packet
which
to
judge
from
the
hinge
like
character
of
its
worn
folds
seemed
to
have
been
carefully
opened
and
closed
a
good
many
times
he
sat
down
on
a
three
legged
milking
stool
that
formed
the
only
seat
in
the
van
and
examining
his
packet
by
the
light
of
a
candle
took
thence
an
old
letter
and
spread
it
open
the
writing
had
originally
been
traced
on
white
paper
but
the
letter
had
now
assumed
a
pale
red
tinge
from
the
accident
of
its
situation
and
the
black
strokes
of
writing
thereon
looked
like
the
twigs
of
a
winter
hedge
against
a
vermilion
sunset
the
letter
bore
a
date
some
two
years
previous
to
that
time
and
was
signed
thomasin
yeobright
it
ran
as
follows
dear
diggory
venn
the
question
you
put
when
you
overtook
me
coming
home
from
pond
close
gave
me
such
a
surprise
that
i
am
afraid
i
did
not
make
you
exactly
understand
what
i
meant
of
course
if
my
aunt
had
not
met
me
i
could
have
explained
all
then
at
once
but
as
it
was
there
was
no
chance
i
have
been
quite
uneasy
since
as
you
know
i
do
not
wish
to
pain
you
yet
i
fear
i
shall
be
doing
so
now
in
contradicting
what
i
seemed
to
say
then
i
cannot
diggory
marry
you
or
think
of
letting
you
call
me
your
sweetheart
i
could
not
indeed
diggory
i
hope
you
will
not
much
mind
my
saying
this
and
feel
in
a
great
pain
it
makes
me
very
sad
when
i
think
it
may
for
i
like
you
very
much
and
i
always
put
you
next
to
my
cousin
clym
in
my
mind
there
are
so
many
reasons
why
we
cannot
be
married
that
i
can
hardly
name
them
all
in
a
letter
i
did
not
in
the
least
expect
that
you
were
going
to
speak
on
such
a
thing
when
you
followed
me
because
i
had
never
thought
of
you
in
the
sense
of
a
lover
at
all
you
must
not
becall
me
for
laughing
when
you
spoke
you
mistook
when
you
thought
i
laughed
at
you
as
a
foolish
man
i
laughed
because
the
idea
was
so
odd
and
not
at
you
at
all
the
great
reason
with
my
own
personal
self
for
not
letting
you
court
me
is
that
i
do
not
feel
the
things
a
woman
ought
to
feel
who
consents
to
walk
with
you
with
the
meaning
of
being
your
wife
it
is
not
as
you
think
that
i
have
another
in
my
mind
for
i
do
not
encourage
anybody
and
never
have
in
my
life
another
reason
is
my
aunt
she
would
not
i
know
agree
to
it
even
if
i
wished
to
have
you
she
likes
you
very
well
but
she
will
want
me
to
look
a
little
higher
than
a
small
dairy
farmer
and
marry
a
professional
man
i
hope
you
will
not
set
your
heart
against
me
for
writing
plainly
but
i
felt
you
might
try
to
see
me
again
and
it
is
better
that
we
should
not
meet
i
shall
always
think
of
you
as
a
good
man
and
be
anxious
for
your
well
doing
i
send
this
by
jane
orchard
s
little
maid
and
remain
diggory
your
faithful
friend
thomasin
yeobright
to
mr
venn
dairy
farmer
since
the
arrival
of
that
letter
on
a
certain
autumn
morning
long
ago
the
reddleman
and
thomasin
had
not
met
till
today
during
the
interval
he
had
shifted
his
position
even
further
from
hers
than
it
had
originally
been
by
adopting
the
reddle
trade
though
he
was
really
in
very
good
circumstances
still
indeed
seeing
that
his
expenditure
was
only
one
fourth
of
his
income
he
might
have
been
called
a
prosperous
man
rejected
suitors
take
to
roaming
as
naturally
as
unhived
bees
and
the
business
to
which
he
had
cynically
devoted
himself
was
in
many
ways
congenial
to
venn
but
his
wanderings
by
mere
stress
of
old
emotions
had
frequently
taken
an
egdon
direction
though
he
never
intruded
upon
her
who
attracted
him
thither
to
be
in
thomasin
s
heath
and
near
her
yet
unseen
was
the
one
ewe
lamb
of
pleasure
left
to
him
then
came
the
incident
of
that
day
and
the
reddleman
still
loving
her
well
was
excited
by
this
accidental
service
to
her
at
a
critical
juncture
to
vow
an
active
devotion
to
her
cause
instead
of
as
hitherto
sighing
and
holding
aloof
after
what
had
happened
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
not
doubt
the
honesty
of
wildeve
s
intentions
but
her
hope
was
apparently
centred
upon
him
and
dismissing
his
regrets
venn
determined
to
aid
her
to
be
happy
in
her
own
chosen
way
that
this
way
was
of
all
others
the
most
distressing
to
himself
was
awkward
enough
but
the
reddleman
s
love
was
generous
his
first
active
step
in
watching
over
thomasin
s
interests
was
taken
about
seven
o
clock
the
next
evening
and
was
dictated
by
the
news
which
he
had
learnt
from
the
sad
boy
that
eustacia
was
somehow
the
cause
of
wildeve
s
carelessness
in
relation
to
the
marriage
had
at
once
been
venn
s
conclusion
on
hearing
of
the
secret
meeting
between
them
it
did
not
occur
to
his
mind
that
eustacia
s
love
signal
to
wildeve
was
the
tender
effect
upon
the
deserted
beauty
of
the
intelligence
which
her
grandfather
had
brought
home
his
instinct
was
to
regard
her
as
a
conspirator
against
rather
than
as
an
antecedent
obstacle
to
thomasin
s
happiness
during
the
day
he
had
been
exceedingly
anxious
to
learn
the
condition
of
thomasin
but
he
did
not
venture
to
intrude
upon
a
threshold
to
which
he
was
a
stranger
particularly
at
such
an
unpleasant
moment
as
this
he
had
occupied
his
time
in
moving
with
his
ponies
and
load
to
a
new
point
in
the
heath
eastward
to
his
previous
station
and
here
he
selected
a
nook
with
a
careful
eye
to
shelter
from
wind
and
rain
which
seemed
to
mean
that
his
stay
there
was
to
be
a
comparatively
extended
one
after
this
he
returned
on
foot
some
part
of
the
way
that
he
had
come
and
it
being
now
dark
he
diverged
to
the
left
till
he
stood
behind
a
holly
bush
on
the
edge
of
a
pit
not
twenty
yards
from
rainbarrow
he
watched
for
a
meeting
there
but
he
watched
in
vain
nobody
except
himself
came
near
the
spot
that
night
but
the
loss
of
his
labour
produced
little
effect
upon
the
reddleman
he
had
stood
in
the
shoes
of
tantalus
and
seemed
to
look
upon
a
certain
mass
of
disappointment
as
the
natural
preface
to
all
realizations
without
which
preface
they
would
give
cause
for
alarm
the
same
hour
the
next
evening
found
him
again
at
the
same
place
but
eustacia
and
wildeve
the
expected
trysters
did
not
appear
he
pursued
precisely
the
same
course
yet
four
nights
longer
and
without
success
but
on
the
next
being
the
day
week
of
their
previous
meeting
he
saw
a
female
shape
floating
along
the
ridge
and
the
outline
of
a
young
man
ascending
from
the
valley
they
met
in
the
little
ditch
encircling
the
tumulus
the
original
excavation
from
which
it
had
been
thrown
up
by
the
ancient
british
people
the
reddleman
stung
with
suspicion
of
wrong
to
thomasin
was
aroused
to
strategy
in
a
moment
he
instantly
left
the
bush
and
crept
forward
on
his
hands
and
knees
when
he
had
got
as
close
as
he
might
safely
venture
without
discovery
he
found
that
owing
to
a
cross
wind
the
conversation
of
the
trysting
pair
could
not
be
overheard
near
him
as
in
divers
places
about
the
heath
were
areas
strewn
with
large
turves
which
lay
edgeways
and
upside
down
awaiting
removal
by
timothy
fairway
previous
to
the
winter
weather
he
took
two
of
these
as
he
lay
and
dragged
them
over
him
till
one
covered
his
head
and
shoulders
the
other
his
back
and
legs
the
reddleman
would
now
have
been
quite
invisible
even
by
daylight
the
turves
standing
upon
him
with
the
heather
upwards
looked
precisely
as
if
they
were
growing
he
crept
along
again
and
the
turves
upon
his
back
crept
with
him
had
he
approached
without
any
covering
the
chances
are
that
he
would
not
have
been
perceived
in
the
dusk
approaching
thus
it
was
as
though
he
burrowed
underground
in
this
manner
he
came
quite
close
to
where
the
two
were
standing
wish
to
consult
me
on
the
matter
reached
his
ears
in
the
rich
impetuous
accents
of
eustacia
vye
consult
me
it
is
an
indignity
to
me
to
talk
so
i
won
t
bear
it
any
longer
she
began
weeping
i
have
loved
you
and
have
shown
you
that
i
loved
you
much
to
my
regret
and
yet
you
can
come
and
say
in
that
frigid
way
that
you
wish
to
consult
with
me
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
marry
thomasin
better
of
course
it
would
be
marry
her
she
is
nearer
to
your
own
position
in
life
than
i
am
yes
yes
that
s
very
well
said
wildeve
peremptorily
but
we
must
look
at
things
as
they
are
whatever
blame
may
attach
to
me
for
having
brought
it
about
thomasin
s
position
is
at
present
much
worse
than
yours
i
simply
tell
you
that
i
am
in
a
strait
but
you
shall
not
tell
me
you
must
see
that
it
is
only
harassing
me
damon
you
have
not
acted
well
you
have
sunk
in
my
opinion
you
have
not
valued
my
courtesy
the
courtesy
of
a
lady
in
loving
you
who
used
to
think
of
far
more
ambitious
things
but
it
was
thomasin
s
fault
she
won
you
away
from
me
and
she
deserves
to
suffer
for
it
where
is
she
staying
now
not
that
i
care
nor
where
i
am
myself
ah
if
i
were
dead
and
gone
how
glad
she
would
be
where
is
she
i
ask
thomasin
is
now
staying
at
her
aunt
s
shut
up
in
a
bedroom
and
keeping
out
of
everybody
s
sight
he
said
indifferently
i
don
t
think
you
care
much
about
her
even
now
said
eustacia
with
sudden
joyousness
for
if
you
did
you
wouldn
t
talk
so
coolly
about
her
do
you
talk
so
coolly
to
her
about
me
ah
i
expect
you
do
why
did
you
originally
go
away
from
me
i
don
t
think
i
can
ever
forgive
you
except
on
one
condition
that
whenever
you
desert
me
you
come
back
again
sorry
that
you
served
me
so
i
never
wish
to
desert
you
i
do
not
thank
you
for
that
i
should
hate
it
to
be
all
smooth
indeed
i
think
i
like
you
to
desert
me
a
little
once
now
and
then
love
is
the
dismallest
thing
where
the
lover
is
quite
honest
o
it
is
a
shame
to
say
so
but
it
is
true
she
indulged
in
a
little
laugh
my
low
spirits
begin
at
the
very
idea
don
t
you
offer
me
tame
love
or
away
you
go
i
wish
tamsie
were
not
such
a
confoundedly
good
little
woman
said
wildeve
so
that
i
could
be
faithful
to
you
without
injuring
a
worthy
person
it
is
i
who
am
the
sinner
after
all
i
am
not
worth
the
little
finger
of
either
of
you
but
you
must
not
sacrifice
yourself
to
her
from
any
sense
of
justice
replied
eustacia
quickly
if
you
do
not
love
her
it
is
the
most
merciful
thing
in
the
long
run
to
leave
her
as
she
is
that
s
always
the
best
way
there
now
i
have
been
unwomanly
i
suppose
when
you
have
left
me
i
am
always
angry
with
myself
for
things
that
i
have
said
to
you
wildeve
walked
a
pace
or
two
among
the
heather
without
replying
the
pause
was
filled
up
by
the
intonation
of
a
pollard
thorn
a
little
way
to
windward
the
breezes
filtering
through
its
unyielding
twigs
as
through
a
strainer
it
was
as
if
the
night
sang
dirges
with
clenched
teeth
she
continued
half
sorrowfully
since
meeting
you
last
it
has
occurred
to
me
once
or
twice
that
perhaps
it
was
not
for
love
of
me
you
did
not
marry
her
tell
me
damon
i
ll
try
to
bear
it
had
i
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
matter
do
you
press
me
to
tell
yes
i
must
know
i
see
i
have
been
too
ready
to
believe
in
my
own
power
well
the
immediate
reason
was
that
the
license
would
not
do
for
the
place
and
before
i
could
get
another
she
ran
away
up
to
that
point
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
since
then
her
aunt
has
spoken
to
me
in
a
tone
which
i
don
t
at
all
like
yes
yes
i
am
nothing
in
it
i
am
nothing
in
it
you
only
trifle
with
me
heaven
what
can
i
eustacia
vye
be
made
of
to
think
so
much
of
you
nonsense
do
not
be
so
passionate
eustacia
how
we
roved
among
these
bushes
last
year
when
the
hot
days
had
got
cool
and
the
shades
of
the
hills
kept
us
almost
invisible
in
the
hollows
she
remained
in
moody
silence
till
she
said
yes
and
how
i
used
to
laugh
at
you
for
daring
to
look
up
to
me
but
you
have
well
made
me
suffer
for
that
since
yes
you
served
me
cruelly
enough
until
i
thought
i
had
found
someone
fairer
than
you
a
blessed
find
for
me
eustacia
do
you
still
think
you
found
somebody
fairer
sometimes
i
do
sometimes
i
don
t
the
scales
are
balanced
so
nicely
that
a
feather
would
turn
them
but
don
t
you
really
care
whether
i
meet
you
or
whether
i
don
t
she
said
slowly
i
care
a
little
but
not
enough
to
break
my
rest
replied
the
young
man
languidly
no
all
that
s
past
i
find
there
are
two
flowers
where
i
thought
there
was
only
one
perhaps
there
are
three
or
four
or
any
number
as
good
as
the
first
mine
is
a
curious
fate
who
would
have
thought
that
all
this
could
happen
to
me
she
interrupted
with
a
suppressed
fire
of
which
either
love
or
anger
seemed
an
equally
possible
issue
do
you
love
me
now
who
can
say
tell
me
i
will
know
it
i
do
and
i
do
not
said
he
mischievously
that
is
i
have
my
times
and
my
seasons
one
moment
you
are
too
tall
another
moment
you
are
too
do
nothing
another
too
melancholy
another
too
dark
another
i
don
t
know
what
except
that
you
are
not
the
whole
world
to
me
that
you
used
to
be
my
dear
but
you
are
a
pleasant
lady
to
know
and
nice
to
meet
and
i
dare
say
as
sweet
as
ever
almost
eustacia
was
silent
and
she
turned
from
him
till
she
said
in
a
voice
of
suspended
mightiness
i
am
for
a
walk
and
this
is
my
way
well
i
can
do
worse
than
follow
you
you
know
you
can
t
do
otherwise
for
all
your
moods
and
changes
she
answered
defiantly
say
what
you
will
try
as
you
may
keep
away
from
me
all
that
you
can
you
will
never
forget
me
you
will
love
me
all
your
life
long
you
would
jump
to
marry
me
so
i
would
said
wildeve
such
strange
thoughts
as
i
ve
had
from
time
to
time
eustacia
and
they
come
to
me
this
moment
you
hate
the
heath
as
much
as
ever
that
i
know
i
do
she
murmured
deeply
tis
my
cross
my
shame
and
will
be
my
death
i
abhor
it
too
said
he
how
mournfully
the
wind
blows
round
us
now
she
did
not
answer
its
tone
was
indeed
solemn
and
pervasive
compound
utterances
addressed
themselves
to
their
senses
and
it
was
possible
to
view
by
ear
the
features
of
the
neighbourhood
acoustic
pictures
were
returned
from
the
darkened
scenery
they
could
hear
where
the
tracts
of
heather
began
and
ended
where
the
furze
was
growing
stalky
and
tall
where
it
had
been
recently
cut
in
what
direction
the
fir
clump
lay
and
how
near
was
the
pit
in
which
the
hollies
grew
for
these
differing
features
had
their
voices
no
less
than
their
shapes
and
colours
god
how
lonely
it
is
resumed
wildeve
what
are
picturesque
ravines
and
mists
to
us
who
see
nothing
else
why
should
we
stay
here
will
you
go
with
me
to
america
i
have
kindred
in
wisconsin
that
wants
consideration
it
seems
impossible
to
do
well
here
unless
one
were
a
wild
bird
or
a
landscape
painter
well
give
me
time
she
softly
said
taking
his
hand
america
is
so
far
away
are
you
going
to
walk
with
me
a
little
way
as
eustacia
uttered
the
latter
words
she
retired
from
the
base
of
the
barrow
and
wildeve
followed
her
so
that
the
reddleman
could
hear
no
more
he
lifted
the
turves
and
arose
their
black
figures
sank
and
disappeared
from
against
the
sky
they
were
as
two
horns
which
the
sluggish
heath
had
put
forth
from
its
crown
like
a
mollusc
and
had
now
again
drawn
in
the
reddleman
s
walk
across
the
vale
and
over
into
the
next
where
his
cart
lay
was
not
sprightly
for
a
slim
young
fellow
of
twenty
four
his
spirit
was
perturbed
to
aching
the
breezes
that
blew
around
his
mouth
in
that
walk
carried
off
upon
them
the
accents
of
a
commination
he
entered
the
van
where
there
was
a
fire
in
a
stove
without
lighting
his
candle
he
sat
down
at
once
on
the
three
legged
stool
and
pondered
on
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
touching
that
still
loved
one
of
his
he
uttered
a
sound
which
was
neither
sigh
nor
sob
but
was
even
more
indicative
than
either
of
a
troubled
mind
my
tamsie
he
whispered
heavily
what
can
be
done
yes
i
will
see
that
eustacia
vye
a
desperate
attempt
at
persuasion
the
next
morning
at
the
time
when
the
height
of
the
sun
appeared
very
insignificant
from
any
part
of
the
heath
as
compared
with
the
altitude
of
rainbarrow
and
when
all
the
little
hills
in
the
lower
levels
were
like
an
archipelago
in
a
fog
formed
aegean
the
reddleman
came
from
the
brambled
nook
which
he
had
adopted
as
his
quarters
and
ascended
the
slopes
of
mistover
knap
though
these
shaggy
hills
were
apparently
so
solitary
several
keen
round
eyes
were
always
ready
on
such
a
wintry
morning
as
this
to
converge
upon
a
passer
by
feathered
species
sojourned
here
in
hiding
which
would
have
created
wonder
if
found
elsewhere
a
bustard
haunted
the
spot
and
not
many
years
before
this
five
and
twenty
might
have
been
seen
in
egdon
at
one
time
marsh
harriers
looked
up
from
the
valley
by
wildeve
s
a
cream
coloured
courser
had
used
to
visit
this
hill
a
bird
so
rare
that
not
more
than
a
dozen
have
ever
been
seen
in
england
but
a
barbarian
rested
neither
night
nor
day
till
he
had
shot
the
african
truant
and
after
that
event
cream
coloured
coursers
thought
fit
to
enter
egdon
no
more
a
traveller
who
should
walk
and
observe
any
of
these
visitants
as
venn
observed
them
now
could
feel
himself
to
be
in
direct
communication
with
regions
unknown
to
man
here
in
front
of
him
was
a
wild
mallard
just
arrived
from
the
home
of
the
north
wind
the
creature
brought
within
him
an
amplitude
of
northern
knowledge
glacial
catastrophes
snowstorm
episodes
glittering
auroral
effects
polaris
in
the
zenith
franklin
underfoot
the
category
of
his
commonplaces
was
wonderful
but
the
bird
like
many
other
philosophers
seemed
as
he
looked
at
the
reddleman
to
think
that
a
present
moment
of
comfortable
reality
was
worth
a
decade
of
memories
venn
passed
on
through
these
towards
the
house
of
the
isolated
beauty
who
lived
up
among
them
and
despised
them
the
day
was
sunday
but
as
going
to
church
except
to
be
married
or
buried
was
exceptional
at
egdon
this
made
little
difference
he
had
determined
upon
the
bold
stroke
of
asking
for
an
interview
with
miss
vye
to
attack
her
position
as
thomasin
s
rival
either
by
art
or
by
storm
showing
therein
somewhat
too
conspicuously
the
want
of
gallantry
characteristic
of
a
certain
astute
sort
of
men
from
clowns
to
kings
the
great
frederick
making
war
on
the
beautiful
archduchess
napoleon
refusing
terms
to
the
beautiful
queen
of
prussia
were
not
more
dead
to
difference
of
sex
than
the
reddleman
was
in
his
peculiar
way
in
planning
the
displacement
of
eustacia
to
call
at
the
captain
s
cottage
was
always
more
or
less
an
undertaking
for
the
inferior
inhabitants
though
occasionally
chatty
his
moods
were
erratic
and
nobody
could
be
certain
how
he
would
behave
at
any
particular
moment
eustacia
was
reserved
and
lived
very
much
to
herself
except
the
daughter
of
one
of
the
cotters
who
was
their
servant
and
a
lad
who
worked
in
the
garden
and
stable
scarcely
anyone
but
themselves
ever
entered
the
house
they
were
the
only
genteel
people
of
the
district
except
the
yeobrights
and
though
far
from
rich
they
did
not
feel
that
necessity
for
preserving
a
friendly
face
towards
every
man
bird
and
beast
which
influenced
their
poorer
neighbours
when
the
reddleman
entered
the
garden
the
old
man
was
looking
through
his
glass
at
the
stain
of
blue
sea
in
the
distant
landscape
the
little
anchors
on
his
buttons
twinkling
in
the
sun
he
recognized
venn
as
his
companion
on
the
highway
but
made
no
remark
on
that
circumstance
merely
saying
ah
reddleman
you
here
have
a
glass
of
grog
venn
declined
on
the
plea
of
it
being
too
early
and
stated
that
his
business
was
with
miss
vye
the
captain
surveyed
him
from
cap
to
waistcoat
and
from
waistcoat
to
leggings
for
a
few
moments
and
finally
asked
him
to
go
indoors
miss
vye
was
not
to
be
seen
by
anybody
just
then
and
the
reddleman
waited
in
the
window
bench
of
the
kitchen
his
hands
hanging
across
his
divergent
knees
and
his
cap
hanging
from
his
hands
i
suppose
the
young
lady
is
not
up
yet
he
presently
said
to
the
servant
not
quite
yet
folks
never
call
upon
ladies
at
this
time
of
day
then
i
ll
step
outside
said
venn
if
she
is
willing
to
see
me
will
she
please
send
out
word
and
i
ll
come
in
the
reddleman
left
the
house
and
loitered
on
the
hill
adjoining
a
considerable
time
elapsed
and
no
request
for
his
presence
was
brought
he
was
beginning
to
think
that
his
scheme
had
failed
when
he
beheld
the
form
of
eustacia
herself
coming
leisurely
towards
him
a
sense
of
novelty
in
giving
audience
to
that
singular
figure
had
been
sufficient
to
draw
her
forth
she
seemed
to
feel
after
a
bare
look
at
diggory
venn
that
the
man
had
come
on
a
strange
errand
and
that
he
was
not
so
mean
as
she
had
thought
him
for
her
close
approach
did
not
cause
him
to
writhe
uneasily
or
shift
his
feet
or
show
any
of
those
little
signs
which
escape
an
ingenuous
rustic
at
the
advent
of
the
uncommon
in
womankind
on
his
inquiring
if
he
might
have
a
conversation
with
her
she
replied
yes
walk
beside
me
and
continued
to
move
on
before
they
had
gone
far
it
occurred
to
the
perspicacious
reddleman
that
he
would
have
acted
more
wisely
by
appearing
less
unimpressionable
and
he
resolved
to
correct
the
error
as
soon
as
he
could
find
opportunity
i
have
made
so
bold
miss
as
to
step
across
and
tell
you
some
strange
news
which
has
come
to
my
ears
about
that
man
ah
what
man
he
jerked
his
elbow
to
the
southeast
the
direction
of
the
quiet
woman
eustacia
turned
quickly
to
him
do
you
mean
mr
wildeve
yes
there
is
trouble
in
a
household
on
account
of
him
and
i
have
come
to
let
you
know
of
it
because
i
believe
you
might
have
power
to
drive
it
away
i
what
is
the
trouble
it
is
quite
a
secret
it
is
that
he
may
refuse
to
marry
thomasin
yeobright
after
all
eustacia
though
set
inwardly
pulsing
by
his
words
was
equal
to
her
part
in
such
a
drama
as
this
she
replied
coldly
i
do
not
wish
to
listen
to
this
and
you
must
not
expect
me
to
interfere
but
miss
you
will
hear
one
word
i
cannot
i
am
not
interested
in
the
marriage
and
even
if
i
were
i
could
not
compel
mr
wildeve
to
do
my
bidding
as
the
only
lady
on
the
heath
i
think
you
might
said
venn
with
subtle
indirectness
this
is
how
the
case
stands
mr
wildeve
would
marry
thomasin
at
once
and
make
all
matters
smooth
if
so
be
there
were
not
another
woman
in
the
case
this
other
woman
is
some
person
he
has
picked
up
with
and
meets
on
the
heath
occasionally
i
believe
he
will
never
marry
her
and
yet
through
her
he
may
never
marry
the
woman
who
loves
him
dearly
now
if
you
miss
who
have
so
much
sway
over
us
menfolk
were
to
insist
that
he
should
treat
your
young
neighbour
tamsin
with
honourable
kindness
and
give
up
the
other
woman
he
would
perhaps
do
it
and
save
her
a
good
deal
of
misery
ah
my
life
said
eustacia
with
a
laugh
which
unclosed
her
lips
so
that
the
sun
shone
into
her
mouth
as
into
a
tulip
and
lent
it
a
similar
scarlet
fire
you
think
too
much
of
my
influence
over
menfolk
indeed
reddleman
if
i
had
such
a
power
as
you
imagine
i
would
go
straight
and
use
it
for
the
good
of
anybody
who
has
been
kind
to
me
which
thomasin
yeobright
has
not
particularly
to
my
knowledge
can
it
be
that
you
really
don
t
know
of
it
how
much
she
had
always
thought
of
you
i
have
never
heard
a
word
of
it
although
we
live
only
two
miles
apart
i
have
never
been
inside
her
aunt
s
house
in
my
life
the
superciliousness
that
lurked
in
her
manner
told
venn
that
thus
far
he
had
utterly
failed
he
inwardly
sighed
and
felt
it
necessary
to
unmask
his
second
argument
well
leaving
that
out
of
the
question
tis
in
your
power
i
assure
you
miss
vye
to
do
a
great
deal
of
good
to
another
woman
she
shook
her
head
your
comeliness
is
law
with
mr
wildeve
it
is
law
with
all
men
who
see
ee
they
say
this
well
favoured
lady
coming
what
s
her
name
how
handsome
handsomer
than
thomasin
yeobright
the
reddleman
persisted
saying
to
himself
god
forgive
a
rascal
for
lying
and
she
was
handsomer
but
the
reddleman
was
far
from
thinking
so
there
was
a
certain
obscurity
in
eustacia
s
beauty
and
venn
s
eye
was
not
trained
in
her
winter
dress
as
now
she
was
like
the
tiger
beetle
which
when
observed
in
dull
situations
seems
to
be
of
the
quietest
neutral
colour
but
under
a
full
illumination
blazes
with
dazzling
splendour
eustacia
could
not
help
replying
though
conscious
that
she
endangered
her
dignity
thereby
many
women
are
lovelier
than
thomasin
she
said
so
not
much
attaches
to
that
the
reddleman
suffered
the
wound
and
went
on
he
is
a
man
who
notices
the
looks
of
women
and
you
could
twist
him
to
your
will
like
withywind
if
you
only
had
the
mind
surely
what
she
cannot
do
who
has
been
so
much
with
him
i
cannot
do
living
up
here
away
from
him
the
reddleman
wheeled
and
looked
her
in
the
face
miss
vye
he
said
why
do
you
say
that
as
if
you
doubted
me
she
spoke
faintly
and
her
breathing
was
quick
the
idea
of
your
speaking
in
that
tone
to
me
she
added
with
a
forced
smile
of
hauteur
what
could
have
been
in
your
mind
to
lead
you
to
speak
like
that
miss
vye
why
should
you
make
believe
that
you
don
t
know
this
man
i
know
why
certainly
he
is
beneath
you
and
you
are
ashamed
you
are
mistaken
what
do
you
mean
the
reddleman
had
decided
to
play
the
card
of
truth
i
was
at
the
meeting
by
rainbarrow
last
night
and
heard
every
word
he
said
the
woman
that
stands
between
wildeve
and
thomasin
is
yourself
it
was
a
disconcerting
lift
of
the
curtain
and
the
mortification
of
candaules
wife
glowed
in
her
the
moment
had
arrived
when
her
lip
would
tremble
in
spite
of
herself
and
when
the
gasp
could
no
longer
be
kept
down
i
am
unwell
she
said
hurriedly
no
it
is
not
that
i
am
not
in
a
humour
to
hear
you
further
leave
me
please
i
must
speak
miss
vye
in
spite
of
paining
you
what
i
would
put
before
you
is
this
however
it
may
come
about
whether
she
is
to
blame
or
you
her
case
is
without
doubt
worse
than
yours
your
giving
up
mr
wildeve
will
be
a
real
advantage
to
you
for
how
could
you
marry
him
now
she
cannot
get
off
so
easily
everybody
will
blame
her
if
she
loses
him
then
i
ask
you
not
because
her
right
is
best
but
because
her
situation
is
worst
to
give
him
up
to
her
no
i
won
t
i
won
t
she
said
impetuously
quite
forgetful
of
her
previous
manner
towards
the
reddleman
as
an
underling
nobody
has
ever
been
served
so
it
was
going
on
well
i
will
not
be
beaten
down
by
an
inferior
woman
like
her
it
is
very
well
for
you
to
come
and
plead
for
her
but
is
she
not
herself
the
cause
of
all
her
own
trouble
am
i
not
to
show
favour
to
any
person
i
may
choose
without
asking
permission
of
a
parcel
of
cottagers
she
has
come
between
me
and
my
inclination
and
now
that
she
finds
herself
rightly
punished
she
gets
you
to
plead
for
her
indeed
said
venn
earnestly
she
knows
nothing
whatever
about
it
it
is
only
i
who
ask
you
to
give
him
up
it
will
be
better
for
her
and
you
both
people
will
say
bad
things
if
they
find
out
that
a
lady
secretly
meets
a
man
who
has
ill
used
another
woman
i
have
not
injured
her
he
was
mine
before
he
was
hers
he
came
back
because
because
he
liked
me
best
she
said
wildly
but
i
lose
all
self
respect
in
talking
to
you
what
am
i
giving
way
to
i
can
keep
secrets
said
venn
gently
you
need
not
fear
i
am
the
only
man
who
knows
of
your
meetings
with
him
there
is
but
one
thing
more
to
speak
of
and
then
i
will
be
gone
i
heard
you
say
to
him
that
you
hated
living
here
that
egdon
heath
was
a
jail
to
you
i
did
say
so
there
is
a
sort
of
beauty
in
the
scenery
i
know
but
it
is
a
jail
to
me
the
man
you
mention
does
not
save
me
from
that
feeling
though
he
lives
here
i
should
have
cared
nothing
for
him
had
there
been
a
better
person
near
the
reddleman
looked
hopeful
after
these
words
from
her
his
third
attempt
seemed
promising
as
we
have
now
opened
our
minds
a
bit
miss
he
said
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
have
got
to
propose
since
i
have
taken
to
the
reddle
trade
i
travel
a
good
deal
as
you
know
she
inclined
her
head
and
swept
round
so
that
her
eyes
rested
in
the
misty
vale
beneath
them
and
in
my
travels
i
go
near
budmouth
now
budmouth
is
a
wonderful
place
wonderful
a
great
salt
sheening
sea
bending
into
the
land
like
a
bow
thousands
of
gentlepeople
walking
up
and
down
bands
of
music
playing
officers
by
sea
and
officers
by
land
walking
among
the
rest
out
of
every
ten
folks
you
meet
nine
of
em
in
love
i
know
it
she
said
disdainfully
i
know
budmouth
better
than
you
i
was
born
there
my
father
came
to
be
a
military
musician
there
from
abroad
ah
my
soul
budmouth
i
wish
i
was
there
now
the
reddleman
was
surprised
to
see
how
a
slow
fire
could
blaze
on
occasion
if
you
were
miss
he
replied
in
a
week
s
time
you
would
think
no
more
of
wildeve
than
of
one
of
those
he
th
croppers
that
we
see
yond
now
i
could
get
you
there
how
said
eustacia
with
intense
curiosity
in
her
heavy
eyes
my
uncle
has
been
for
five
and
twenty
years
the
trusty
man
of
a
rich
widow
lady
who
has
a
beautiful
house
facing
the
sea
this
lady
has
become
old
and
lame
and
she
wants
a
young
company
keeper
to
read
and
sing
to
her
but
can
t
get
one
to
her
mind
to
save
her
life
though
she
ve
advertised
in
the
papers
and
tried
half
a
dozen
she
would
jump
to
get
you
and
uncle
would
make
it
all
easy
i
should
have
to
work
perhaps
no
not
real
work
you
d
have
a
little
to
do
such
as
reading
and
that
you
would
not
be
wanted
till
new
year
s
day
i
knew
it
meant
work
she
said
drooping
to
languor
again
i
confess
there
would
be
a
trifle
to
do
in
the
way
of
amusing
her
but
though
idle
people
might
call
it
work
working
people
would
call
it
play
think
of
the
company
and
the
life
you
d
lead
miss
the
gaiety
you
d
see
and
the
gentleman
you
d
marry
my
uncle
is
to
inquire
for
a
trustworthy
young
lady
from
the
country
as
she
don
t
like
town
girls
it
is
to
wear
myself
out
to
please
her
and
i
won
t
go
o
if
i
could
live
in
a
gay
town
as
a
lady
should
and
go
my
own
ways
and
do
my
own
doings
i
d
give
the
wrinkled
half
of
my
life
yes
reddleman
that
would
i
help
me
to
get
thomasin
happy
miss
and
the
chance
shall
be
yours
urged
her
companion
chance
tis
no
chance
she
said
proudly
what
can
a
poor
man
like
you
offer
me
indeed
i
am
going
indoors
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
don
t
your
horses
want
feeding
or
your
reddlebags
want
mending
or
don
t
you
want
to
find
buyers
for
your
goods
that
you
stay
idling
here
like
this
venn
spoke
not
another
word
with
his
hands
behind
him
he
turned
away
that
she
might
not
see
the
hopeless
disappointment
in
his
face
the
mental
clearness
and
power
he
had
found
in
this
lonely
girl
had
indeed
filled
his
manner
with
misgiving
even
from
the
first
few
minutes
of
close
quarters
with
her
her
youth
and
situation
had
led
him
to
expect
a
simplicity
quite
at
the
beck
of
his
method
but
a
system
of
inducement
which
might
have
carried
weaker
country
lasses
along
with
it
had
merely
repelled
eustacia
as
a
rule
the
word
budmouth
meant
fascination
on
egdon
that
royal
port
and
watering
place
if
truly
mirrored
in
the
minds
of
the
heathfolk
must
have
combined
in
a
charming
and
indescribable
manner
a
carthaginian
bustle
of
building
with
tarentine
luxuriousness
and
baian
health
and
beauty
eustacia
felt
little
less
extravagantly
about
the
place
but
she
would
not
sink
her
independence
to
get
there
when
diggory
venn
had
gone
quite
away
eustacia
walked
to
the
bank
and
looked
down
the
wild
and
picturesque
vale
towards
the
sun
which
was
also
in
the
direction
of
wildeve
s
the
mist
had
now
so
far
collapsed
that
the
tips
of
the
trees
and
bushes
around
his
house
could
just
be
discerned
as
if
boring
upwards
through
a
vast
white
cobweb
which
cloaked
them
from
the
day
there
was
no
doubt
that
her
mind
was
inclined
thitherward
indefinitely
fancifully
twining
and
untwining
about
him
as
the
single
object
within
her
horizon
on
which
dreams
might
crystallize
the
man
who
had
begun
by
being
merely
her
amusement
and
would
never
have
been
more
than
her
hobby
but
for
his
skill
in
deserting
her
at
the
right
moments
was
now
again
her
desire
cessation
in
his
love
making
had
revivified
her
love
such
feeling
as
eustacia
had
idly
given
to
wildeve
was
dammed
into
a
flood
by
thomasin
she
had
used
to
tease
wildeve
but
that
was
before
another
had
favoured
him
often
a
drop
of
irony
into
an
indifferent
situation
renders
the
whole
piquant
i
will
never
give
him
up
never
she
said
impetuously
the
reddleman
s
hint
that
rumour
might
show
her
to
disadvantage
had
no
permanent
terror
for
eustacia
she
was
as
unconcerned
at
that
contingency
as
a
goddess
at
a
lack
of
linen
this
did
not
originate
in
inherent
shamelessness
but
in
her
living
too
far
from
the
world
to
feel
the
impact
of
public
opinion
zenobia
in
the
desert
could
hardly
have
cared
what
was
said
about
her
at
rome
as
far
as
social
ethics
were
concerned
eustacia
approached
the
savage
state
though
in
emotion
she
was
all
the
while
an
epicure
she
had
advanced
to
the
secret
recesses
of
sensuousness
yet
had
hardly
crossed
the
threshold
of
conventionality
the
dishonesty
of
an
honest
woman
the
reddleman
had
left
eustacia
s
presence
with
desponding
views
on
thomasin
s
future
happiness
but
he
was
awakened
to
the
fact
that
one
other
channel
remained
untried
by
seeing
as
he
followed
the
way
to
his
van
the
form
of
mrs
yeobright
slowly
walking
towards
the
quiet
woman
he
went
across
to
her
and
could
almost
perceive
in
her
anxious
face
that
this
journey
of
hers
to
wildeve
was
undertaken
with
the
same
object
as
his
own
to
eustacia
she
did
not
conceal
the
fact
then
said
the
reddleman
you
may
as
well
leave
it
alone
mrs
yeobright
i
half
think
so
myself
she
said
but
nothing
else
remains
to
be
done
besides
pressing
the
question
upon
him
i
should
like
to
say
a
word
first
said
venn
firmly
mr
wildeve
is
not
the
only
man
who
has
asked
thomasin
to
marry
him
and
why
should
not
another
have
a
chance
mrs
yeobright
i
should
be
glad
to
marry
your
niece
and
would
have
done
it
any
time
these
last
two
years
there
now
it
is
out
and
i
have
never
told
anybody
before
but
herself
mrs
yeobright
was
not
demonstrative
but
her
eyes
involuntarily
glanced
towards
his
singular
though
shapely
figure
looks
are
not
everything
said
the
reddleman
noticing
the
glance
there
s
many
a
calling
that
don
t
bring
in
so
much
as
mine
if
it
comes
to
money
and
perhaps
i
am
not
so
much
worse
off
than
wildeve
there
is
nobody
so
poor
as
these
professional
fellows
who
have
failed
and
if
you
shouldn
t
like
my
redness
well
i
am
not
red
by
birth
you
know
i
only
took
to
this
business
for
a
freak
and
i
might
turn
my
hand
to
something
else
in
good
time
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
interest
in
my
niece
but
i
fear
there
would
be
objections
more
than
that
she
is
devoted
to
this
man
true
or
i
shouldn
t
have
done
what
i
have
this
morning
otherwise
there
would
be
no
pain
in
the
case
and
you
would
not
see
me
going
to
his
house
now
what
was
thomasin
s
answer
when
you
told
her
of
your
feelings
she
wrote
that
you
would
object
to
me
and
other
things
she
was
in
a
measure
right
you
must
not
take
this
unkindly
i
merely
state
it
as
a
truth
you
have
been
good
to
her
and
we
do
not
forget
it
but
as
she
was
unwilling
on
her
own
account
to
be
your
wife
that
settles
the
point
without
my
wishes
being
concerned
yes
but
there
is
a
difference
between
then
and
now
ma
am
she
is
distressed
now
and
i
have
thought
that
if
you
were
to
talk
to
her
about
me
and
think
favourably
of
me
yourself
there
might
be
a
chance
of
winning
her
round
and
getting
her
quite
independent
of
this
wildeve
s
backward
and
forward
play
and
his
not
knowing
whether
he
ll
have
her
or
no
mrs
yeobright
shook
her
head
thomasin
thinks
and
i
think
with
her
that
she
ought
to
be
wildeve
s
wife
if
she
means
to
appear
before
the
world
without
a
slur
upon
her
name
if
they
marry
soon
everybody
will
believe
that
an
accident
did
really
prevent
the
wedding
if
not
it
may
cast
a
shade
upon
her
character
at
any
rate
make
her
ridiculous
in
short
if
it
is
anyhow
possible
they
must
marry
now
i
thought
that
till
half
an
hour
ago
but
after
all
why
should
her
going
off
with
him
to
anglebury
for
a
few
hours
do
her
any
harm
anybody
who
knows
how
pure
she
is
will
feel
any
such
thought
to
be
quite
unjust
i
have
been
trying
this
morning
to
help
on
this
marriage
with
wildeve
yes
i
ma
am
in
the
belief
that
i
ought
to
do
it
because
she
was
so
wrapped
up
in
him
but
i
much
question
if
i
was
right
after
all
however
nothing
came
of
it
and
now
i
offer
myself
mrs
yeobright
appeared
disinclined
to
enter
further
into
the
question
i
fear
i
must
go
on
she
said
i
do
not
see
that
anything
else
can
be
done
and
she
went
on
but
though
this
conversation
did
not
divert
thomasin
s
aunt
from
her
purposed
interview
with
wildeve
it
made
a
considerable
difference
in
her
mode
of
conducting
that
interview
she
thanked
god
for
the
weapon
which
the
reddleman
had
put
into
her
hands
wildeve
was
at
home
when
she
reached
the
inn
he
showed
her
silently
into
the
parlour
and
closed
the
door
mrs
yeobright
began
i
have
thought
it
my
duty
to
call
today
a
new
proposal
has
been
made
to
me
which
has
rather
astonished
me
it
will
affect
thomasin
greatly
and
i
have
decided
that
it
should
at
least
be
mentioned
to
you
yes
what
is
it
he
said
civilly
it
is
of
course
in
reference
to
her
future
you
may
not
be
aware
that
another
man
has
shown
himself
anxious
to
marry
thomasin
now
though
i
have
not
encouraged
him
yet
i
cannot
conscientiously
refuse
him
a
chance
any
longer
i
don
t
wish
to
be
short
with
you
but
i
must
be
fair
to
him
and
to
her
who
is
the
man
said
wildeve
with
surprise
one
who
has
been
in
love
with
her
longer
than
she
has
with
you
he
proposed
to
her
two
years
ago
at
that
time
she
refused
him
well
he
has
seen
her
lately
and
has
asked
me
for
permission
to
pay
his
addresses
to
her
she
may
not
refuse
him
twice
what
is
his
name
mrs
yeobright
declined
to
say
he
is
a
man
thomasin
likes
she
added
and
one
whose
constancy
she
respects
at
least
it
seems
to
me
that
what
she
refused
then
she
would
be
glad
to
get
now
she
is
much
annoyed
at
her
awkward
position
she
never
once
told
me
of
this
old
lover
the
gentlest
women
are
not
such
fools
as
to
show
every
card
well
if
she
wants
him
i
suppose
she
must
have
him
it
is
easy
enough
to
say
that
but
you
don
t
see
the
difficulty
he
wants
her
much
more
than
she
wants
him
and
before
i
can
encourage
anything
of
the
sort
i
must
have
a
clear
understanding
from
you
that
you
will
not
interfere
to
injure
an
arrangement
which
i
promote
in
the
belief
that
it
is
for
the
best
suppose
when
they
are
engaged
and
everything
is
smoothly
arranged
for
their
marriage
that
you
should
step
between
them
and
renew
your
suit
you
might
not
win
her
back
but
you
might
cause
much
unhappiness
of
course
i
should
do
no
such
thing
said
wildeve
but
they
are
not
engaged
yet
how
do
you
know
that
thomasin
would
accept
him
that
s
a
question
i
have
carefully
put
to
myself
and
upon
the
whole
the
probabilities
are
in
favour
of
her
accepting
him
in
time
i
flatter
myself
that
i
have
some
influence
over
her
she
is
pliable
and
i
can
be
strong
in
my
recommendations
of
him
and
in
your
disparagement
of
me
at
the
same
time
well
you
may
depend
upon
my
not
praising
you
she
said
drily
and
if
this
seems
like
manoeuvring
you
must
remember
that
her
position
is
peculiar
and
that
she
has
been
hardly
used
i
shall
also
be
helped
in
making
the
match
by
her
own
desire
to
escape
from
the
humiliation
of
her
present
state
and
a
woman
s
pride
in
these
cases
will
lead
her
a
very
great
way
a
little
managing
may
be
required
to
bring
her
round
but
i
am
equal
to
that
provided
that
you
agree
to
the
one
thing
indispensable
that
is
to
make
a
distinct
declaration
that
she
is
to
think
no
more
of
you
as
a
possible
husband
that
will
pique
her
into
accepting
him
i
can
hardly
say
that
just
now
mrs
yeobright
it
is
so
sudden
and
so
my
whole
plan
is
interfered
with
it
is
very
inconvenient
that
you
refuse
to
help
my
family
even
to
the
small
extent
of
saying
distinctly
you
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
us
wildeve
reflected
uncomfortably
i
confess
i
was
not
prepared
for
this
he
said
of
course
i
ll
give
her
up
if
you
wish
if
it
is
necessary
but
i
thought
i
might
be
her
husband
we
have
heard
that
before
now
mrs
yeobright
don
t
let
us
disagree
give
me
a
fair
time
i
don
t
want
to
stand
in
the
way
of
any
better
chance
she
may
have
only
i
wish
you
had
let
me
know
earlier
i
will
write
to
you
or
call
in
a
day
or
two
will
that
suffice
yes
she
replied
provided
you
promise
not
to
communicate
with
thomasin
without
my
knowledge
i
promise
that
he
said
and
the
interview
then
terminated
mrs
yeobright
returning
homeward
as
she
had
come
by
far
the
greatest
effect
of
her
simple
strategy
on
that
day
was
as
often
happens
in
a
quarter
quite
outside
her
view
when
arranging
it
in
the
first
place
her
visit
sent
wildeve
the
same
evening
after
dark
to
eustacia
s
house
at
mistover
at
this
hour
the
lonely
dwelling
was
closely
blinded
and
shuttered
from
the
chill
and
darkness
without
wildeve
s
clandestine
plan
with
her
was
to
take
a
little
gravel
in
his
hand
and
hold
it
to
the
crevice
at
the
top
of
the
window
shutter
which
was
on
the
outside
so
that
it
should
fall
with
a
gentle
rustle
resembling
that
of
a
mouse
between
shutter
and
glass
this
precaution
in
attracting
her
attention
was
to
avoid
arousing
the
suspicions
of
her
grandfather
the
soft
words
i
hear
wait
for
me
in
eustacia
s
voice
from
within
told
him
that
she
was
alone
he
waited
in
his
customary
manner
by
walking
round
the
enclosure
and
idling
by
the
pool
for
wildeve
was
never
asked
into
the
house
by
his
proud
though
condescending
mistress
she
showed
no
sign
of
coming
out
in
a
hurry
the
time
wore
on
and
he
began
to
grow
impatient
in
the
course
of
twenty
minutes
she
appeared
from
round
the
corner
and
advanced
as
if
merely
taking
an
airing
you
would
not
have
kept
me
so
long
had
you
known
what
i
come
about
he
said
with
bitterness
still
you
are
worth
waiting
for
what
has
happened
said
eustacia
i
did
not
know
you
were
in
trouble
i
too
am
gloomy
enough
i
am
not
in
trouble
said
he
it
is
merely
that
affairs
have
come
to
a
head
and
i
must
take
a
clear
course
what
course
is
that
she
asked
with
attentive
interest
and
can
you
forget
so
soon
what
i
proposed
to
you
the
other
night
why
take
you
from
this
place
and
carry
you
away
with
me
abroad
i
have
not
forgotten
but
why
have
you
come
so
unexpectedly
to
repeat
the
question
when
you
only
promised
to
come
next
saturday
i
thought
i
was
to
have
plenty
of
time
to
consider
yes
but
the
situation
is
different
now
explain
to
me
i
don
t
want
to
explain
for
i
may
pain
you
but
i
must
know
the
reason
of
this
hurry
it
is
simply
my
ardour
dear
eustacia
everything
is
smooth
now
then
why
are
you
so
ruffled
i
am
not
aware
of
it
all
is
as
it
should
be
mrs
yeobright
but
she
is
nothing
to
us
ah
i
knew
she
had
something
to
do
with
it
come
i
don
t
like
reserve
no
she
has
nothing
she
only
says
she
wishes
me
to
give
up
thomasin
because
another
man
is
anxious
to
marry
her
the
woman
now
she
no
longer
needs
me
actually
shows
off
wildeve
s
vexation
has
escaped
him
in
spite
of
himself
eustacia
was
silent
a
long
while
you
are
in
the
awkward
position
of
an
official
who
is
no
longer
wanted
she
said
in
a
changed
tone
it
seems
so
but
i
have
not
yet
seen
thomasin
and
that
irritates
you
don
t
deny
it
damon
you
are
actually
nettled
by
this
slight
from
an
unexpected
quarter
well
and
you
come
to
get
me
because
you
cannot
get
her
this
is
certainly
a
new
position
altogether
i
am
to
be
a
stop
gap
please
remember
that
i
proposed
the
same
thing
the
other
day
eustacia
again
remained
in
a
sort
of
stupefied
silence
what
curious
feeling
was
this
coming
over
her
was
it
really
possible
that
her
interest
in
wildeve
had
been
so
entirely
the
result
of
antagonism
that
the
glory
and
the
dream
departed
from
the
man
with
the
first
sound
that
he
was
no
longer
coveted
by
her
rival
she
was
then
secure
of
him
at
last
thomasin
no
longer
required
him
what
a
humiliating
victory
he
loved
her
best
she
thought
and
yet
dared
she
to
murmur
such
treacherous
criticism
ever
so
softly
what
was
the
man
worth
whom
a
woman
inferior
to
herself
did
not
value
the
sentiment
which
lurks
more
or
less
in
all
animate
nature
that
of
not
desiring
the
undesired
of
others
was
lively
as
a
passion
in
the
supersubtle
epicurean
heart
of
eustacia
her
social
superiority
over
him
which
hitherto
had
scarcely
ever
impressed
her
became
unpleasantly
insistent
and
for
the
first
time
she
felt
that
she
had
stooped
in
loving
him
well
darling
you
agree
said
wildeve
if
it
could
be
london
or
even
budmouth
instead
of
america
she
murmured
languidly
well
i
will
think
it
is
too
great
a
thing
for
me
to
decide
offhand
i
wish
i
hated
the
heath
less
or
loved
you
more
you
can
be
painfully
frank
you
loved
me
a
month
ago
warmly
enough
to
go
anywhere
with
me
and
you
loved
thomasin
yes
perhaps
that
was
where
the
reason
lay
he
returned
with
almost
a
sneer
i
don
t
hate
her
now
exactly
the
only
thing
is
that
you
can
no
longer
get
her
come
no
taunts
eustacia
or
we
shall
quarrel
if
you
don
t
agree
to
go
with
me
and
agree
shortly
i
shall
go
by
myself
or
try
thomasin
again
damon
how
strange
it
seems
that
you
could
have
married
her
or
me
indifferently
and
only
have
come
to
me
because
i
am
cheapest
yes
yes
it
is
true
there
was
a
time
when
i
should
have
exclaimed
against
a
man
of
that
sort
and
been
quite
wild
but
it
is
all
past
now
will
you
go
dearest
come
secretly
with
me
to
bristol
marry
me
and
turn
our
backs
upon
this
dog
hole
of
england
for
ever
say
yes
i
want
to
get
away
from
here
at
almost
any
cost
she
said
with
weariness
but
i
don
t
like
to
go
with
you
give
me
more
time
to
decide
i
have
already
said
wildeve
well
i
give
you
one
more
week
a
little
longer
so
that
i
may
tell
you
decisively
i
have
to
consider
so
many
things
fancy
thomasin
being
anxious
to
get
rid
of
you
i
cannot
forget
it
never
mind
that
say
monday
week
i
will
be
here
precisely
at
this
time
let
it
be
at
rainbarrow
said
she
this
is
too
near
home
my
grandfather
may
be
walking
out
thank
you
dear
on
monday
week
at
this
time
i
will
be
at
the
barrow
till
then
good
bye
good
bye
no
no
you
must
not
touch
me
now
shaking
hands
is
enough
till
i
have
made
up
my
mind
eustacia
watched
his
shadowy
form
till
it
had
disappeared
she
placed
her
hand
to
her
forehead
and
breathed
heavily
and
then
her
rich
romantic
lips
parted
under
that
homely
impulse
a
yawn
she
was
immediately
angry
at
having
betrayed
even
to
herself
the
possible
evanescence
of
her
passion
for
him
she
could
not
admit
at
once
that
she
might
have
overestimated
wildeve
for
to
perceive
his
mediocrity
now
was
to
admit
her
own
great
folly
heretofore
and
the
discovery
that
she
was
the
owner
of
a
disposition
so
purely
that
of
the
dog
in
the
manger
had
something
in
it
which
at
first
made
her
ashamed
the
fruit
of
mrs
yeobright
s
diplomacy
was
indeed
remarkable
though
not
as
yet
of
the
kind
she
had
anticipated
it
had
appreciably
influenced
wildeve
but
it
was
influencing
eustacia
far
more
her
lover
was
no
longer
to
her
an
exciting
man
whom
many
women
strove
for
and
herself
could
only
retain
by
striving
with
them
he
was
a
superfluity
she
went
indoors
in
that
peculiar
state
of
misery
which
is
not
exactly
grief
and
which
especially
attends
the
dawnings
of
reason
in
the
latter
days
of
an
ill
judged
transient
love
to
be
conscious
that
the
end
of
the
dream
is
approaching
and
yet
has
not
absolutely
come
is
one
of
the
most
wearisome
as
well
as
the
most
curious
stages
along
the
course
between
the
beginning
of
a
passion
and
its
end
her
grandfather
had
returned
and
was
busily
engaged
in
pouring
some
gallons
of
newly
arrived
rum
into
the
square
bottles
of
his
square
cellaret
whenever
these
home
supplies
were
exhausted
he
would
go
to
the
quiet
woman
and
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
grog
in
hand
tell
remarkable
stories
of
how
he
had
lived
seven
years
under
the
waterline
of
his
ship
and
other
naval
wonders
to
the
natives
who
hoped
too
earnestly
for
a
treat
of
ale
from
the
teller
to
exhibit
any
doubts
of
his
truth
he
had
been
there
this
evening
i
suppose
you
have
heard
the
egdon
news
eustacia
he
said
without
looking
up
from
the
bottles
the
men
have
been
talking
about
it
at
the
woman
as
if
it
were
of
national
importance
i
have
heard
none
she
said
young
clym
yeobright
as
they
call
him
is
coming
home
next
week
to
spend
christmas
with
his
mother
he
is
a
fine
fellow
by
this
time
it
seems
i
suppose
you
remember
him
i
never
saw
him
in
my
life
ah
true
he
left
before
you
came
here
i
well
remember
him
as
a
promising
boy
where
has
he
been
living
all
these
years
in
that
rookery
of
pomp
and
vanity
paris
i
believe
book
two
the
arrival
tidings
of
the
comer
on
the
fine
days
at
this
time
of
the
year
and
earlier
certain
ephemeral
operations
were
apt
to
disturb
in
their
trifling
way
the
majestic
calm
of
egdon
heath
they
were
activities
which
beside
those
of
a
town
a
village
or
even
a
farm
would
have
appeared
as
the
ferment
of
stagnation
merely
a
creeping
of
the
flesh
of
somnolence
but
here
away
from
comparisons
shut
in
by
the
stable
hills
among
which
mere
walking
had
the
novelty
of
pageantry
and
where
any
man
could
imagine
himself
to
be
adam
without
the
least
difficulty
they
attracted
the
attention
of
every
bird
within
eyeshot
every
reptile
not
yet
asleep
and
set
the
surrounding
rabbits
curiously
watching
from
hillocks
at
a
safe
distance
the
performance
was
that
of
bringing
together
and
building
into
a
stack
the
furze
faggots
which
humphrey
had
been
cutting
for
the
captain
s
use
during
the
foregoing
fine
days
the
stack
was
at
the
end
of
the
dwelling
and
the
men
engaged
in
building
it
were
humphrey
and
sam
the
old
man
looking
on
it
was
a
fine
and
quiet
afternoon
about
three
o
clock
but
the
winter
solstice
having
stealthily
come
on
the
lowness
of
the
sun
caused
the
hour
to
seem
later
than
it
actually
was
there
being
little
here
to
remind
an
inhabitant
that
he
must
unlearn
his
summer
experience
of
the
sky
as
a
dial
in
the
course
of
many
days
and
weeks
sunrise
had
advanced
its
quarters
from
northeast
to
southeast
sunset
had
receded
from
northwest
to
southwest
but
egdon
had
hardly
heeded
the
change
eustacia
was
indoors
in
the
dining
room
which
was
really
more
like
a
kitchen
having
a
stone
floor
and
a
gaping
chimney
corner
the
air
was
still
and
while
she
lingered
a
moment
here
alone
sounds
of
voices
in
conversation
came
to
her
ears
directly
down
the
chimney
she
entered
the
recess
and
listening
looked
up
the
old
irregular
shaft
with
its
cavernous
hollows
where
the
smoke
blundered
about
on
its
way
to
the
square
bit
of
sky
at
the
top
from
which
the
daylight
struck
down
with
a
pallid
glare
upon
the
tatters
of
soot
draping
the
flue
as
seaweed
drapes
a
rocky
fissure
she
remembered
the
furze
stack
was
not
far
from
the
chimney
and
the
voices
were
those
of
the
workers
her
grandfather
joined
in
the
conversation
that
lad
ought
never
to
have
left
home
his
father
s
occupation
would
have
suited
him
best
and
the
boy
should
have
followed
on
i
don
t
believe
in
these
new
moves
in
families
my
father
was
a
sailor
so
was
i
and
so
should
my
son
have
been
if
i
had
had
one
the
place
he
s
been
living
at
is
paris
said
humphrey
and
they
tell
me
tis
where
the
king
s
head
was
cut
off
years
ago
my
poor
mother
used
to
tell
me
about
that
business
hummy
she
used
to
say
i
was
a
young
maid
then
and
as
i
was
at
home
ironing
mother
s
caps
one
afternoon
the
parson
came
in
and
said
they
ve
cut
the
king
s
head
off
jane
and
what
twill
be
next
god
knows
a
good
many
of
us
knew
as
well
as
he
before
long
said
the
captain
chuckling
i
lived
seven
years
under
water
on
account
of
it
in
my
boyhood
in
that
damned
surgery
of
the
triumph
seeing
men
brought
down
to
the
cockpit
with
their
legs
and
arms
blown
to
jericho
and
so
the
young
man
has
settled
in
paris
manager
to
a
diamond
merchant
or
some
such
thing
is
he
not
yes
sir
that
s
it
tis
a
blazing
great
business
that
he
belongs
to
so
i
ve
heard
his
mother
say
like
a
king
s
palace
as
far
as
diments
go
i
can
well
mind
when
he
left
home
said
sam
tis
a
good
thing
for
the
feller
said
humphrey
a
sight
of
times
better
to
be
selling
diments
than
nobbling
about
here
it
must
cost
a
good
few
shillings
to
deal
at
such
a
place
a
good
few
indeed
my
man
replied
the
captain
yes
you
may
make
away
with
a
deal
of
money
and
be
neither
drunkard
nor
glutton
they
say
too
that
clym
yeobright
is
become
a
real
perusing
man
with
the
strangest
notions
about
things
there
that
s
because
he
went
to
school
early
such
as
the
school
was
strange
notions
has
he
said
the
old
man
ah
there
s
too
much
of
that
sending
to
school
in
these
days
it
only
does
harm
every
gatepost
and
barn
s
door
you
come
to
is
sure
to
have
some
bad
word
or
other
chalked
upon
it
by
the
young
rascals
a
woman
can
hardly
pass
for
shame
sometimes
if
they
d
never
been
taught
how
to
write
they
wouldn
t
have
been
able
to
scribble
such
villainy
their
fathers
couldn
t
do
it
and
the
country
was
all
the
better
for
it
now
i
should
think
cap
n
that
miss
eustacia
had
about
as
much
in
her
head
that
comes
from
books
as
anybody
about
here
perhaps
if
miss
eustacia
too
had
less
romantic
nonsense
in
her
head
it
would
be
better
for
her
said
the
captain
shortly
after
which
he
walked
away
i
say
sam
observed
humphrey
when
the
old
man
was
gone
she
and
clym
yeobright
would
make
a
very
pretty
pigeon
pair
hey
if
they
wouldn
t
i
ll
be
dazed
both
of
one
mind
about
niceties
for
certain
and
learned
in
print
and
always
thinking
about
high
doctrine
there
couldn
t
be
a
better
couple
if
they
were
made
o
purpose
clym
s
family
is
as
good
as
hers
his
father
was
a
farmer
that
s
true
but
his
mother
was
a
sort
of
lady
as
we
know
nothing
would
please
me
better
than
to
see
them
two
man
and
wife
they
d
look
very
natty
arm
in
crook
together
and
their
best
clothes
on
whether
or
no
if
he
s
at
all
the
well
favoured
fellow
he
used
to
be
they
would
humphrey
well
i
should
like
to
see
the
chap
terrible
much
after
so
many
years
if
i
knew
for
certain
when
he
was
coming
i
d
stroll
out
three
or
four
miles
to
meet
him
and
help
carry
anything
for
n
though
i
suppose
he
s
altered
from
the
boy
he
was
they
say
he
can
talk
french
as
fast
as
a
maid
can
eat
blackberries
and
if
so
depend
upon
it
we
who
have
stayed
at
home
shall
seem
no
more
than
scroff
in
his
eyes
coming
across
the
water
to
budmouth
by
steamer
isn
t
he
yes
but
how
he
s
coming
from
budmouth
i
don
t
know
that
s
a
bad
trouble
about
his
cousin
thomasin
i
wonder
such
a
nice
notioned
fellow
as
clym
likes
to
come
home
into
it
what
a
nunnywatch
we
were
in
to
be
sure
when
we
heard
they
weren
t
married
at
all
after
singing
to
em
as
man
and
wife
that
night
be
dazed
if
i
should
like
a
relation
of
mine
to
have
been
made
such
a
fool
of
by
a
man
it
makes
the
family
look
small
yes
poor
maid
her
heart
has
ached
enough
about
it
her
health
is
suffering
from
it
i
hear
for
she
will
bide
entirely
indoors
we
never
see
her
out
now
scampering
over
the
furze
with
a
face
as
red
as
a
rose
as
she
used
to
do
i
ve
heard
she
wouldn
t
have
wildeve
now
if
he
asked
her
you
have
tis
news
to
me
while
the
furze
gatherers
had
desultorily
conversed
thus
eustacia
s
face
gradually
bent
to
the
hearth
in
a
profound
reverie
her
toe
unconsciously
tapping
the
dry
turf
which
lay
burning
at
her
feet
the
subject
of
their
discourse
had
been
keenly
interesting
to
her
a
young
and
clever
man
was
coming
into
that
lonely
heath
from
of
all
contrasting
places
in
the
world
paris
it
was
like
a
man
coming
from
heaven
more
singular
still
the
heathmen
had
instinctively
coupled
her
and
this
man
together
in
their
minds
as
a
pair
born
for
each
other
that
five
minutes
of
overhearing
furnished
eustacia
with
visions
enough
to
fill
the
whole
blank
afternoon
such
sudden
alternations
from
mental
vacuity
do
sometimes
occur
thus
quietly
she
could
never
have
believed
in
the
morning
that
her
colourless
inner
world
would
before
night
become
as
animated
as
water
under
a
microscope
and
that
without
the
arrival
of
a
single
visitor
the
words
of
sam
and
humphrey
on
the
harmony
between
the
unknown
and
herself
had
on
her
mind
the
effect
of
the
invading
bard
s
prelude
in
the
castle
of
indolence
at
which
myriads
of
imprisoned
shapes
arose
where
had
previously
appeared
the
stillness
of
a
void
involved
in
these
imaginings
she
knew
nothing
of
time
when
she
became
conscious
of
externals
it
was
dusk
the
furze
rick
was
finished
the
men
had
gone
home
eustacia
went
upstairs
thinking
that
she
would
take
a
walk
at
this
her
usual
time
and
she
determined
that
her
walk
should
be
in
the
direction
of
blooms
end
the
birthplace
of
young
yeobright
and
the
present
home
of
his
mother
she
had
no
reason
for
walking
elsewhere
and
why
should
she
not
go
that
way
the
scene
of
the
daydream
is
sufficient
for
a
pilgrimage
at
nineteen
to
look
at
the
palings
before
the
yeobrights
house
had
the
dignity
of
a
necessary
performance
strange
that
such
a
piece
of
idling
should
have
seemed
an
important
errand
she
put
on
her
bonnet
and
leaving
the
house
descended
the
hill
on
the
side
towards
blooms
end
where
she
walked
slowly
along
the
valley
for
a
distance
of
a
mile
and
a
half
this
brought
her
to
a
spot
in
which
the
green
bottom
of
the
dale
began
to
widen
the
furze
bushes
to
recede
yet
further
from
the
path
on
each
side
till
they
were
diminished
to
an
isolated
one
here
and
there
by
the
increasing
fertility
of
the
soil
beyond
the
irregular
carpet
of
grass
was
a
row
of
white
palings
which
marked
the
verge
of
the
heath
in
this
latitude
they
showed
upon
the
dusky
scene
that
they
bordered
as
distinctly
as
white
lace
on
velvet
behind
the
white
palings
was
a
little
garden
behind
the
garden
an
old
irregular
thatched
house
facing
the
heath
and
commanding
a
full
view
of
the
valley
this
was
the
obscure
removed
spot
to
which
was
about
to
return
a
man
whose
latter
life
had
been
passed
in
the
french
capital
the
centre
and
vortex
of
the
fashionable
world
the
people
at
blooms
end
make
ready
all
that
afternoon
the
expected
arrival
of
the
subject
of
eustacia
s
ruminations
created
a
bustle
of
preparation
at
blooms
end
thomasin
had
been
persuaded
by
her
aunt
and
by
an
instinctive
impulse
of
loyalty
towards
her
cousin
clym
to
bestir
herself
on
his
account
with
an
alacrity
unusual
in
her
during
these
most
sorrowful
days
of
her
life
at
the
time
that
eustacia
was
listening
to
the
rick
makers
conversation
on
clym
s
return
thomasin
was
climbing
into
a
loft
over
her
aunt
s
fuelhouse
where
the
store
apples
were
kept
to
search
out
the
best
and
largest
of
them
for
the
coming
holiday
time
the
loft
was
lighted
by
a
semicircular
hole
through
which
the
pigeons
crept
to
their
lodgings
in
the
same
high
quarters
of
the
premises
and
from
this
hole
the
sun
shone
in
a
bright
yellow
patch
upon
the
figure
of
the
maiden
as
she
knelt
and
plunged
her
naked
arms
into
the
soft
brown
fern
which
from
its
abundance
was
used
on
egdon
in
packing
away
stores
of
all
kinds
the
pigeons
were
flying
about
her
head
with
the
greatest
unconcern
and
the
face
of
her
aunt
was
just
visible
above
the
floor
of
the
loft
lit
by
a
few
stray
motes
of
light
as
she
stood
halfway
up
the
ladder
looking
at
a
spot
into
which
she
was
not
climber
enough
to
venture
now
a
few
russets
tamsin
he
used
to
like
them
almost
as
well
as
ribstones
thomasin
turned
and
rolled
aside
the
fern
from
another
nook
where
more
mellow
fruit
greeted
her
with
its
ripe
smell
before
picking
them
out
she
stopped
a
moment
dear
clym
i
wonder
how
your
face
looks
now
she
said
gazing
abstractedly
at
the
pigeon
hole
which
admitted
the
sunlight
so
directly
upon
her
brown
hair
and
transparent
tissues
that
it
almost
seemed
to
shine
through
her
if
he
could
have
been
dear
to
you
in
another
way
said
mrs
yeobright
from
the
ladder
this
might
have
been
a
happy
meeting
is
there
any
use
in
saying
what
can
do
no
good
aunt
yes
said
her
aunt
with
some
warmth
to
thoroughly
fill
the
air
with
the
past
misfortune
so
that
other
girls
may
take
warning
and
keep
clear
of
it
thomasin
lowered
her
face
to
the
apples
again
i
am
a
warning
to
others
just
as
thieves
and
drunkards
and
gamblers
are
she
said
in
a
low
voice
what
a
class
to
belong
to
do
i
really
belong
to
them
tis
absurd
yet
why
aunt
does
everybody
keep
on
making
me
think
that
i
do
by
the
way
they
behave
towards
me
why
don
t
people
judge
me
by
my
acts
now
look
at
me
as
i
kneel
here
picking
up
these
apples
do
i
look
like
a
lost
woman
i
wish
all
good
women
were
as
good
as
i
she
added
vehemently
strangers
don
t
see
you
as
i
do
said
mrs
yeobright
they
judge
from
false
report
well
it
is
a
silly
job
and
i
am
partly
to
blame
how
quickly
a
rash
thing
can
be
done
replied
the
girl
her
lips
were
quivering
and
tears
so
crowded
themselves
into
her
eyes
that
she
could
hardly
distinguish
apples
from
fern
as
she
continued
industriously
searching
to
hide
her
weakness
as
soon
as
you
have
finished
getting
the
apples
her
aunt
said
descending
the
ladder
come
down
and
we
ll
go
for
the
holly
there
is
nobody
on
the
heath
this
afternoon
and
you
need
not
fear
being
stared
at
we
must
get
some
berries
or
clym
will
never
believe
in
our
preparations
thomasin
came
down
when
the
apples
were
collected
and
together
they
went
through
the
white
palings
to
the
heath
beyond
the
open
hills
were
airy
and
clear
and
the
remote
atmosphere
appeared
as
it
often
appears
on
a
fine
winter
day
in
distinct
planes
of
illumination
independently
toned
the
rays
which
lit
the
nearer
tracts
of
landscape
streaming
visibly
across
those
further
off
a
stratum
of
ensaffroned
light
was
imposed
on
a
stratum
of
deep
blue
and
behind
these
lay
still
remoter
scenes
wrapped
in
frigid
grey
they
reached
the
place
where
the
hollies
grew
which
was
in
a
conical
pit
so
that
the
tops
of
the
trees
were
not
much
above
the
general
level
of
the
ground
thomasin
stepped
up
into
a
fork
of
one
of
the
bushes
as
she
had
done
under
happier
circumstances
on
many
similar
occasions
and
with
a
small
chopper
that
they
had
brought
she
began
to
lop
off
the
heavily
berried
boughs
don
t
scratch
your
face
said
her
aunt
who
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
pit
regarding
the
girl
as
she
held
on
amid
the
glistening
green
and
scarlet
masses
of
the
tree
will
you
walk
with
me
to
meet
him
this
evening
i
should
like
to
else
it
would
seem
as
if
i
had
forgotten
him
said
thomasin
tossing
out
a
bough
not
that
that
would
matter
much
i
belong
to
one
man
nothing
can
alter
that
and
that
man
i
must
marry
for
my
pride
s
sake
i
am
afraid
began
mrs
yeobright
ah
you
think
that
weak
girl
how
is
she
going
to
get
a
man
to
marry
her
when
she
chooses
but
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
aunt
mr
wildeve
is
not
a
profligate
man
any
more
than
i
am
an
improper
woman
he
has
an
unfortunate
manner
and
doesn
t
try
to
make
people
like
him
if
they
don
t
wish
to
do
it
of
their
own
accord
thomasin
said
mrs
yeobright
quietly
fixing
her
eye
upon
her
niece
do
you
think
you
deceive
me
in
your
defence
of
mr
wildeve
how
do
you
mean
i
have
long
had
a
suspicion
that
your
love
for
him
has
changed
its
colour
since
you
have
found
him
not
to
be
the
saint
you
thought
him
and
that
you
act
a
part
to
me
he
wished
to
marry
me
and
i
wish
to
marry
him
now
i
put
it
to
you
would
you
at
this
present
moment
agree
to
be
his
wife
if
that
had
not
happened
to
entangle
you
with
him
thomasin
looked
into
the
tree
and
appeared
much
disturbed
aunt
she
said
presently
i
have
i
think
a
right
to
refuse
to
answer
that
question
yes
you
have
you
may
think
what
you
choose
i
have
never
implied
to
you
by
word
or
deed
that
i
have
grown
to
think
otherwise
of
him
and
i
never
will
and
i
shall
marry
him
well
wait
till
he
repeats
his
offer
i
think
he
may
do
it
now
that
he
knows
something
i
told
him
i
don
t
for
a
moment
dispute
that
it
is
the
most
proper
thing
for
you
to
marry
him
much
as
i
have
objected
to
him
in
bygone
days
i
agree
with
you
now
you
may
be
sure
it
is
the
only
way
out
of
a
false
position
and
a
very
galling
one
what
did
you
tell
him
that
he
was
standing
in
the
way
of
another
lover
of
yours
aunt
said
thomasin
with
round
eyes
what
do
you
mean
don
t
be
alarmed
it
was
my
duty
i
can
say
no
more
about
it
now
but
when
it
is
over
i
will
tell
you
exactly
what
i
said
and
why
i
said
it
thomasin
was
perforce
content
and
you
will
keep
the
secret
of
my
would
be
marriage
from
clym
for
the
present
she
next
asked
i
have
given
my
word
to
but
what
is
the
use
of
it
he
must
soon
know
what
has
happened
a
mere
look
at
your
face
will
show
him
that
something
is
wrong
thomasin
turned
and
regarded
her
aunt
from
the
tree
now
hearken
to
me
she
said
her
delicate
voice
expanding
into
firmness
by
a
force
which
was
other
than
physical
tell
him
nothing
if
he
finds
out
that
i
am
not
worthy
to
be
his
cousin
let
him
but
since
he
loved
me
once
we
will
not
pain
him
by
telling
him
my
trouble
too
soon
the
air
is
full
of
the
story
i
know
but
gossips
will
not
dare
to
speak
of
it
to
him
for
the
first
few
days
his
closeness
to
me
is
the
very
thing
that
will
hinder
the
tale
from
reaching
him
early
if
i
am
not
made
safe
from
sneers
in
a
week
or
two
i
will
tell
him
myself
the
earnestness
with
which
thomasin
spoke
prevented
further
objections
her
aunt
simply
said
very
well
he
should
by
rights
have
been
told
at
the
time
that
the
wedding
was
going
to
be
he
will
never
forgive
you
for
your
secrecy
yes
he
will
when
he
knows
it
was
because
i
wished
to
spare
him
and
that
i
did
not
expect
him
home
so
soon
and
you
must
not
let
me
stand
in
the
way
of
your
christmas
party
putting
it
off
would
only
make
matters
worse
of
course
i
shall
not
i
do
not
wish
to
show
myself
beaten
before
all
egdon
and
the
sport
of
a
man
like
wildeve
we
have
enough
berries
now
i
think
and
we
had
better
take
them
home
by
the
time
we
have
decked
the
house
with
this
and
hung
up
the
mistletoe
we
must
think
of
starting
to
meet
him
thomasin
came
out
of
the
tree
shook
from
her
hair
and
dress
the
loose
berries
which
had
fallen
thereon
and
went
down
the
hill
with
her
aunt
each
woman
bearing
half
the
gathered
boughs
it
was
now
nearly
four
o
clock
and
the
sunlight
was
leaving
the
vales
when
the
west
grew
red
the
two
relatives
came
again
from
the
house
and
plunged
into
the
heath
in
a
different
direction
from
the
first
towards
a
point
in
the
distant
highway
along
which
the
expected
man
was
to
return
how
a
little
sound
produced
a
great
dream
eustacia
stood
just
within
the
heath
straining
her
eyes
in
the
direction
of
mrs
yeobright
s
house
and
premises
no
light
sound
or
movement
was
perceptible
there
the
evening
was
chilly
the
spot
was
dark
and
lonely
she
inferred
that
the
guest
had
not
yet
come
and
after
lingering
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
she
turned
again
towards
home
she
had
not
far
retraced
her
steps
when
sounds
in
front
of
her
betokened
the
approach
of
persons
in
conversation
along
the
same
path
soon
their
heads
became
visible
against
the
sky
they
were
walking
slowly
and
though
it
was
too
dark
for
much
discovery
of
character
from
aspect
the
gait
of
them
showed
that
they
were
not
workers
on
the
heath
eustacia
stepped
a
little
out
of
the
foot
track
to
let
them
pass
they
were
two
women
and
a
man
and
the
voices
of
the
women
were
those
of
mrs
yeobright
and
thomasin
they
went
by
her
and
at
the
moment
of
passing
appeared
to
discern
her
dusky
form
there
came
to
her
ears
in
a
masculine
voice
good
night
she
murmured
a
reply
glided
by
them
and
turned
round
she
could
not
for
a
moment
believe
that
chance
unrequested
had
brought
into
her
presence
the
soul
of
the
house
she
had
gone
to
inspect
the
man
without
whom
her
inspection
would
not
have
been
thought
of
she
strained
her
eyes
to
see
them
but
was
unable
such
was
her
intentness
however
that
it
seemed
as
if
her
ears
were
performing
the
functions
of
seeing
as
well
as
hearing
this
extension
of
power
can
almost
be
believed
in
at
such
moments
the
deaf
dr
kitto
was
probably
under
the
influence
of
a
parallel
fancy
when
he
described
his
body
as
having
become
by
long
endeavour
so
sensitive
to
vibrations
that
he
had
gained
the
power
of
perceiving
by
it
as
by
ears
she
could
follow
every
word
that
the
ramblers
uttered
they
were
talking
no
secrets
they
were
merely
indulging
in
the
ordinary
vivacious
chat
of
relatives
who
have
long
been
parted
in
person
though
not
in
soul
but
it
was
not
to
the
words
that
eustacia
listened
she
could
not
even
have
recalled
a
few
minutes
later
what
the
words
were
it
was
to
the
alternating
voice
that
gave
out
about
one
tenth
of
them
the
voice
that
had
wished
her
good
night
sometimes
this
throat
uttered
yes
sometimes
it
uttered
no
sometimes
it
made
inquiries
about
a
time
worn
denizen
of
the
place
once
it
surprised
her
notions
by
remarking
upon
the
friendliness
and
geniality
written
in
the
faces
of
the
hills
around
the
three
voices
passed
on
and
decayed
and
died
out
upon
her
ear
thus
much
had
been
granted
her
and
all
besides
withheld
no
event
could
have
been
more
exciting
during
the
greater
part
of
the
afternoon
she
had
been
entrancing
herself
by
imagining
the
fascination
which
must
attend
a
man
come
direct
from
beautiful
paris
laden
with
its
atmosphere
familiar
with
its
charms
and
this
man
had
greeted
her
with
the
departure
of
the
figures
the
profuse
articulations
of
the
women
wasted
away
from
her
memory
but
the
accents
of
the
other
stayed
on
was
there
anything
in
the
voice
of
mrs
yeobright
s
son
for
clym
it
was
startling
as
a
sound
no
it
was
simply
comprehensive
all
emotional
things
were
possible
to
the
speaker
of
that
good
night
eustacia
s
imagination
supplied
the
rest
except
the
solution
to
one
riddle
what
could
the
tastes
of
that
man
be
who
saw
friendliness
and
geniality
in
these
shaggy
hills
on
such
occasions
as
this
a
thousand
ideas
pass
through
a
highly
charged
woman
s
head
and
they
indicate
themselves
on
her
face
but
the
changes
though
actual
are
minute
eustacia
s
features
went
through
a
rhythmical
succession
of
them
she
glowed
remembering
the
mendacity
of
the
imagination
she
flagged
then
she
freshened
then
she
fired
then
she
cooled
again
it
was
a
cycle
of
aspects
produced
by
a
cycle
of
visions
eustacia
entered
her
own
house
she
was
excited
her
grandfather
was
enjoying
himself
over
the
fire
raking
about
the
ashes
and
exposing
the
red
hot
surface
of
the
turves
so
that
their
lurid
glare
irradiated
the
chimney
corner
with
the
hues
of
a
furnace
why
is
it
that
we
are
never
friendly
with
the
yeobrights
she
said
coming
forward
and
stretching
her
soft
hands
over
the
warmth
i
wish
we
were
they
seem
to
be
very
nice
people
be
hanged
if
i
know
why
said
the
captain
i
liked
the
old
man
well
enough
though
he
was
as
rough
as
a
hedge
but
you
would
never
have
cared
to
go
there
even
if
you
might
have
i
am
well
sure
why
shouldn
t
i
your
town
tastes
would
find
them
far
too
countrified
they
sit
in
the
kitchen
drink
mead
and
elder
wine
and
sand
the
floor
to
keep
it
clean
a
sensible
way
of
life
but
how
would
you
like
it
i
thought
mrs
yeobright
was
a
ladylike
woman
a
curate
s
daughter
was
she
not
yes
but
she
was
obliged
to
live
as
her
husband
did
and
i
suppose
she
has
taken
kindly
to
it
by
this
time
ah
i
recollect
that
i
once
accidentally
offended
her
and
i
have
never
seen
her
since
that
night
was
an
eventful
one
to
eustacia
s
brain
and
one
which
she
hardly
ever
forgot
she
dreamt
a
dream
and
few
human
beings
from
nebuchadnezzar
to
the
swaffham
tinker
ever
dreamt
a
more
remarkable
one
such
an
elaborately
developed
perplexing
exciting
dream
was
certainly
never
dreamed
by
a
girl
in
eustacia
s
situation
before
it
had
as
many
ramifications
as
the
cretan
labyrinth
as
many
fluctuations
as
the
northern
lights
as
much
colour
as
a
parterre
in
june
and
was
as
crowded
with
figures
as
a
coronation
to
queen
scheherazade
the
dream
might
have
seemed
not
far
removed
from
commonplace
and
to
a
girl
just
returned
from
all
the
courts
of
europe
it
might
have
seemed
not
more
than
interesting
but
amid
the
circumstances
of
eustacia
s
life
it
was
as
wonderful
as
a
dream
could
be
there
was
however
gradually
evolved
from
its
transformation
scenes
a
less
extravagant
episode
in
which
the
heath
dimly
appeared
behind
the
general
brilliancy
of
the
action
she
was
dancing
to
wondrous
music
and
her
partner
was
the
man
in
silver
armour
who
had
accompanied
her
through
the
previous
fantastic
changes
the
visor
of
his
helmet
being
closed
the
mazes
of
the
dance
were
ecstatic
soft
whispering
came
into
her
ear
from
under
the
radiant
helmet
and
she
felt
like
a
woman
in
paradise
suddenly
these
two
wheeled
out
from
the
mass
of
dancers
dived
into
one
of
the
pools
of
the
heath
and
came
out
somewhere
into
an
iridescent
hollow
arched
with
rainbows
it
must
be
here
said
the
voice
by
her
side
and
blushingly
looking
up
she
saw
him
removing
his
casque
to
kiss
her
at
that
moment
there
was
a
cracking
noise
and
his
figure
fell
into
fragments
like
a
pack
of
cards
she
cried
aloud
o
that
i
had
seen
his
face
eustacia
awoke
the
cracking
had
been
that
of
the
window
shutter
downstairs
which
the
maid
servant
was
opening
to
let
in
the
day
now
slowly
increasing
to
nature
s
meagre
allowance
at
this
sickly
time
of
the
year
o
that
i
had
seen
his
face
she
said
again
twas
meant
for
mr
yeobright
when
she
became
cooler
she
perceived
that
many
of
the
phases
of
the
dream
had
naturally
arisen
out
of
the
images
and
fancies
of
the
day
before
but
this
detracted
little
from
its
interest
which
lay
in
the
excellent
fuel
it
provided
for
newly
kindled
fervour
she
was
at
the
modulating
point
between
indifference
and
love
at
the
stage
called
having
a
fancy
for
it
occurs
once
in
the
history
of
the
most
gigantic
passions
and
it
is
a
period
when
they
are
in
the
hands
of
the
weakest
will
the
perfervid
woman
was
by
this
time
half
in
love
with
a
vision
the
fantastic
nature
of
her
passion
which
lowered
her
as
an
intellect
raised
her
as
a
soul
if
she
had
had
a
little
more
self
control
she
would
have
attenuated
the
emotion
to
nothing
by
sheer
reasoning
and
so
have
killed
it
off
if
she
had
had
a
little
less
pride
she
might
have
gone
and
circumambulated
the
yeobrights
premises
at
blooms
end
at
any
maidenly
sacrifice
until
she
had
seen
him
but
eustacia
did
neither
of
these
things
she
acted
as
the
most
exemplary
might
have
acted
being
so
influenced
she
took
an
airing
twice
or
thrice
a
day
upon
the
egdon
hills
and
kept
her
eyes
employed
the
first
occasion
passed
and
he
did
not
come
that
way
she
promenaded
a
second
time
and
was
again
the
sole
wanderer
there
the
third
time
there
was
a
dense
fog
she
looked
around
but
without
much
hope
even
if
he
had
been
walking
within
twenty
yards
of
her
she
could
not
have
seen
him
at
the
fourth
attempt
to
encounter
him
it
began
to
rain
in
torrents
and
she
turned
back
the
fifth
sally
was
in
the
afternoon
it
was
fine
and
she
remained
out
long
walking
to
the
very
top
of
the
valley
in
which
blooms
end
lay
she
saw
the
white
paling
about
half
a
mile
off
but
he
did
not
appear
it
was
almost
with
heart
sickness
that
she
came
home
and
with
a
sense
of
shame
at
her
weakness
she
resolved
to
look
for
the
man
from
paris
no
more
but
providence
is
nothing
if
not
coquettish
and
no
sooner
had
eustacia
formed
this
resolve
than
the
opportunity
came
which
while
sought
had
been
entirely
withholden
eustacia
is
led
on
to
an
adventure
in
the
evening
of
this
last
day
of
expectation
which
was
the
twenty
third
of
december
eustacia
was
at
home
alone
she
had
passed
the
recent
hour
in
lamenting
over
a
rumour
newly
come
to
her
ears
that
yeobright
s
visit
to
his
mother
was
to
be
of
short
duration
and
would
end
some
time
the
next
week
naturally
she
said
to
herself
a
man
in
the
full
swing
of
his
activities
in
a
gay
city
could
not
afford
to
linger
long
on
egdon
heath
that
she
would
behold
face
to
face
the
owner
of
the
awakening
voice
within
the
limits
of
such
a
holiday
was
most
unlikely
unless
she
were
to
haunt
the
environs
of
his
mother
s
house
like
a
robin
to
do
which
was
difficult
and
unseemly
the
customary
expedient
of
provincial
girls
and
men
in
such
circumstances
is
churchgoing
in
an
ordinary
village
or
country
town
one
can
safely
calculate
that
either
on
christmas
day
or
the
sunday
contiguous
any
native
home
for
the
holidays
who
has
not
through
age
or
ennui
lost
the
appetite
for
seeing
and
being
seen
will
turn
up
in
some
pew
or
other
shining
with
hope
self
consciousness
and
new
clothes
thus
the
congregation
on
christmas
morning
is
mostly
a
tussaud
collection
of
celebrities
who
have
been
born
in
the
neighbourhood
hither
the
mistress
left
neglected
at
home
all
the
year
can
steal
and
observe
the
development
of
the
returned
lover
who
has
forgotten
her
and
think
as
she
watches
him
over
her
prayer
book
that
he
may
throb
with
a
renewed
fidelity
when
novelties
have
lost
their
charm
and
hither
a
comparatively
recent
settler
like
eustacia
may
betake
herself
to
scrutinize
the
person
of
a
native
son
who
left
home
before
her
advent
upon
the
scene
and
consider
if
the
friendship
of
his
parents
be
worth
cultivating
during
his
next
absence
in
order
to
secure
a
knowledge
of
him
on
his
next
return
but
these
tender
schemes
were
not
feasible
among
the
scattered
inhabitants
of
egdon
heath
in
name
they
were
parishioners
but
virtually
they
belonged
to
no
parish
at
all
people
who
came
to
these
few
isolated
houses
to
keep
christmas
with
their
friends
remained
in
their
friends
chimney
corners
drinking
mead
and
other
comforting
liquors
till
they
left
again
for
good
and
all
rain
snow
ice
mud
everywhere
around
they
did
not
care
to
trudge
two
or
three
miles
to
sit
wet
footed
and
splashed
to
the
nape
of
their
necks
among
those
who
though
in
some
measure
neighbours
lived
close
to
the
church
and
entered
it
clean
and
dry
eustacia
knew
it
was
ten
to
one
that
clym
yeobright
would
go
to
no
church
at
all
during
his
few
days
of
leave
and
that
it
would
be
a
waste
of
labour
for
her
to
go
driving
the
pony
and
gig
over
a
bad
road
in
hope
to
see
him
there
it
was
dusk
and
she
was
sitting
by
the
fire
in
the
dining
room
or
hall
which
they
occupied
at
this
time
of
the
year
in
preference
to
the
parlour
because
of
its
large
hearth
constructed
for
turf
fires
a
fuel
the
captain
was
partial
to
in
the
winter
season
the
only
visible
articles
in
the
room
were
those
on
the
window
sill
which
showed
their
shapes
against
the
low
sky
the
middle
article
being
the
old
hourglass
and
the
other
two
a
pair
of
ancient
british
urns
which
had
been
dug
from
a
barrow
near
and
were
used
as
flowerpots
for
two
razor
leaved
cactuses
somebody
knocked
at
the
door
the
servant
was
out
so
was
her
grandfather
the
person
after
waiting
a
minute
came
in
and
tapped
at
the
door
of
the
room
who
s
there
said
eustacia
please
cap
n
vye
will
you
let
us
eustacia
arose
and
went
to
the
door
i
cannot
allow
you
to
come
in
so
boldly
you
should
have
waited
the
cap
n
said
i
might
come
in
without
any
fuss
was
answered
in
a
lad
s
pleasant
voice
oh
did
he
said
eustacia
more
gently
what
do
you
want
charley
please
will
your
grandfather
lend
us
his
fuelhouse
to
try
over
our
parts
in
tonight
at
seven
o
clock
what
are
you
one
of
the
egdon
mummers
for
this
year
yes
miss
the
cap
n
used
to
let
the
old
mummers
practise
here
i
know
it
yes
you
may
use
the
fuelhouse
if
you
like
said
eustacia
languidly
the
choice
of
captain
vye
s
fuelhouse
as
the
scene
of
rehearsal
was
dictated
by
the
fact
that
his
dwelling
was
nearly
in
the
centre
of
the
heath
the
fuelhouse
was
as
roomy
as
a
barn
and
was
a
most
desirable
place
for
such
a
purpose
the
lads
who
formed
the
company
of
players
lived
at
different
scattered
points
around
and
by
meeting
in
this
spot
the
distances
to
be
traversed
by
all
the
comers
would
be
about
equally
proportioned
for
mummers
and
mumming
eustacia
had
the
greatest
contempt
the
mummers
themselves
were
not
afflicted
with
any
such
feeling
for
their
art
though
at
the
same
time
they
were
not
enthusiastic
a
traditional
pastime
is
to
be
distinguished
from
a
mere
revival
in
no
more
striking
feature
than
in
this
that
while
in
the
revival
all
is
excitement
and
fervour
the
survival
is
carried
on
with
a
stolidity
and
absence
of
stir
which
sets
one
wondering
why
a
thing
that
is
done
so
perfunctorily
should
be
kept
up
at
all
like
balaam
and
other
unwilling
prophets
the
agents
seem
moved
by
an
inner
compulsion
to
say
and
do
their
allotted
parts
whether
they
will
or
no
this
unweeting
manner
of
performance
is
the
true
ring
by
which
in
this
refurbishing
age
a
fossilized
survival
may
be
known
from
a
spurious
reproduction
the
piece
was
the
well
known
play
of
saint
george
and
all
who
were
behind
the
scenes
assisted
in
the
preparations
including
the
women
of
each
household
without
the
co
operation
of
sisters
and
sweethearts
the
dresses
were
likely
to
be
a
failure
but
on
the
other
hand
this
class
of
assistance
was
not
without
its
drawbacks
the
girls
could
never
be
brought
to
respect
tradition
in
designing
and
decorating
the
armour
they
insisted
on
attaching
loops
and
bows
of
silk
and
velvet
in
any
situation
pleasing
to
their
taste
gorget
gusset
basinet
cuirass
gauntlet
sleeve
all
alike
in
the
view
of
these
feminine
eyes
were
practicable
spaces
whereon
to
sew
scraps
of
fluttering
colour
it
might
be
that
joe
who
fought
on
the
side
of
christendom
had
a
sweetheart
and
that
jim
who
fought
on
the
side
of
the
moslem
had
one
likewise
during
the
making
of
the
costumes
it
would
come
to
the
knowledge
of
joe
s
sweetheart
that
jim
s
was
putting
brilliant
silk
scallops
at
the
bottom
of
her
lover
s
surcoat
in
addition
to
the
ribbons
of
the
visor
the
bars
of
which
being
invariably
formed
of
coloured
strips
about
half
an
inch
wide
hanging
before
the
face
were
mostly
of
that
material
joe
s
sweetheart
straight
way
placed
brilliant
silk
on
the
scallops
of
the
hem
in
question
and
going
a
little
further
added
ribbon
tufts
to
the
shoulder
pieces
jim
s
not
to
be
outdone
would
affix
bows
and
rosettes
everywhere
the
result
was
that
in
the
end
the
valiant
soldier
of
the
christian
army
was
distinguished
by
no
peculiarity
of
accoutrement
from
the
turkish
knight
and
what
was
worse
on
a
casual
view
saint
george
himself
might
be
mistaken
for
his
deadly
enemy
the
saracen
the
guisers
themselves
though
inwardly
regretting
this
confusion
of
persons
could
not
afford
to
offend
those
by
whose
assistance
they
so
largely
profited
and
the
innovations
were
allowed
to
stand
there
was
it
is
true
a
limit
to
this
tendency
to
uniformity
the
leech
or
doctor
preserved
his
character
intact
his
darker
habiliments
peculiar
hat
and
the
bottle
of
physic
slung
under
his
arm
could
never
be
mistaken
and
the
same
might
be
said
of
the
conventional
figure
of
father
christmas
with
his
gigantic
club
an
older
man
who
accompanied
the
band
as
general
protector
in
long
night
journeys
from
parish
to
parish
and
was
bearer
of
the
purse
seven
o
clock
the
hour
of
the
rehearsal
came
round
and
in
a
short
time
eustacia
could
hear
voices
in
the
fuelhouse
to
dissipate
in
some
trifling
measure
her
abiding
sense
of
the
murkiness
of
human
life
she
went
to
the
linhay
or
lean
to
shed
which
formed
the
root
store
of
their
dwelling
and
abutted
on
the
fuelhouse
here
was
a
small
rough
hole
in
the
mud
wall
originally
made
for
pigeons
through
which
the
interior
of
the
next
shed
could
be
viewed
a
light
came
from
it
now
and
eustacia
stepped
upon
a
stool
to
look
in
upon
the
scene
on
a
ledge
in
the
fuelhouse
stood
three
tall
rushlights
and
by
the
light
of
them
seven
or
eight
lads
were
marching
about
haranguing
and
confusing
each
other
in
endeavours
to
perfect
themselves
in
the
play
humphrey
and
sam
the
furze
and
turf
cutters
were
there
looking
on
so
also
was
timothy
fairway
who
leant
against
the
wall
and
prompted
the
boys
from
memory
interspersing
among
the
set
words
remarks
and
anecdotes
of
the
superior
days
when
he
and
others
were
the
egdon
mummers
elect
that
these
lads
were
now
well
ye
be
as
well
up
to
it
as
ever
ye
will
be
he
said
not
that
such
mumming
would
have
passed
in
our
time
harry
as
the
saracen
should
strut
a
bit
more
and
john
needn
t
holler
his
inside
out
beyond
that
perhaps
you
ll
do
have
you
got
all
your
clothes
ready
we
shall
by
monday
your
first
outing
will
be
monday
night
i
suppose
yes
at
mrs
yeobright
s
oh
mrs
yeobright
s
what
makes
her
want
to
see
ye
i
should
think
a
middle
aged
woman
was
tired
of
mumming
she
s
got
up
a
bit
of
a
party
because
tis
the
first
christmas
that
her
son
clym
has
been
home
for
a
long
time
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
her
party
i
am
going
myself
i
almost
forgot
it
upon
my
life
eustacia
s
face
flagged
there
was
to
be
a
party
at
the
yeobrights
she
naturally
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
she
was
a
stranger
to
all
such
local
gatherings
and
had
always
held
them
as
scarcely
appertaining
to
her
sphere
but
had
she
been
going
what
an
opportunity
would
have
been
afforded
her
of
seeing
the
man
whose
influence
was
penetrating
her
like
summer
sun
to
increase
that
influence
was
coveted
excitement
to
cast
it
off
might
be
to
regain
serenity
to
leave
it
as
it
stood
was
tantalizing
the
lads
and
men
prepared
to
leave
the
premises
and
eustacia
returned
to
her
fireside
she
was
immersed
in
thought
but
not
for
long
in
a
few
minutes
the
lad
charley
who
had
come
to
ask
permission
to
use
the
place
returned
with
the
key
to
the
kitchen
eustacia
heard
him
and
opening
the
door
into
the
passage
said
charley
come
here
the
lad
was
surprised
he
entered
the
front
room
not
without
blushing
for
he
like
many
had
felt
the
power
of
this
girl
s
face
and
form
she
pointed
to
a
seat
by
the
fire
and
entered
the
other
side
of
the
chimney
corner
herself
it
could
be
seen
in
her
face
that
whatever
motive
she
might
have
had
in
asking
the
youth
indoors
would
soon
appear
which
part
do
you
play
charley
the
turkish
knight
do
you
not
inquired
the
beauty
looking
across
the
smoke
of
the
fire
to
him
on
the
other
side
yes
miss
the
turkish
knight
he
replied
diffidently
is
yours
a
long
part
nine
speeches
about
can
you
repeat
them
to
me
if
so
i
should
like
to
hear
them
the
lad
smiled
into
the
glowing
turf
and
began
here
come
i
a
turkish
knight
who
learnt
in
turkish
land
to
fight
continuing
the
discourse
throughout
the
scenes
to
the
concluding
catastrophe
of
his
fall
by
the
hand
of
saint
george
eustacia
had
occasionally
heard
the
part
recited
before
when
the
lad
ended
she
began
precisely
in
the
same
words
and
ranted
on
without
hitch
or
divergence
till
she
too
reached
the
end
it
was
the
same
thing
yet
how
different
like
in
form
it
had
the
added
softness
and
finish
of
a
raffaelle
after
perugino
which
while
faithfully
reproducing
the
original
subject
entirely
distances
the
original
art
charley
s
eyes
rounded
with
surprise
well
you
be
a
clever
lady
he
said
in
admiration
i
ve
been
three
weeks
learning
mine
i
have
heard
it
before
she
quietly
observed
now
would
you
do
anything
to
please
me
charley
i
d
do
a
good
deal
miss
would
you
let
me
play
your
part
for
one
night
oh
miss
but
your
woman
s
gown
you
couldn
t
i
can
get
boy
s
clothes
at
least
all
that
would
be
wanted
besides
the
mumming
dress
what
should
i
have
to
give
you
to
lend
me
your
things
to
let
me
take
your
place
for
an
hour
or
two
on
monday
night
and
on
no
account
to
say
a
word
about
who
or
what
i
am
you
would
of
course
have
to
excuse
yourself
from
playing
that
night
and
to
say
that
somebody
a
cousin
of
miss
vye
s
would
act
for
you
the
other
mummers
have
never
spoken
to
me
in
their
lives
so
that
it
would
be
safe
enough
and
if
it
were
not
i
should
not
mind
now
what
must
i
give
you
to
agree
to
this
half
a
crown
the
youth
shook
his
head
five
shillings
he
shook
his
head
again
money
won
t
do
it
he
said
brushing
the
iron
head
of
the
firedog
with
the
hollow
of
his
hand
what
will
then
charley
said
eustacia
in
a
disappointed
tone
you
know
what
you
forbade
me
at
the
maypoling
miss
murmured
the
lad
without
looking
at
her
and
still
stroking
the
firedog
s
head
yes
said
eustacia
with
a
little
more
hauteur
you
wanted
to
join
hands
with
me
in
the
ring
if
i
recollect
half
an
hour
of
that
and
i
ll
agree
miss
eustacia
regarded
the
youth
steadfastly
he
was
three
years
younger
than
herself
but
apparently
not
backward
for
his
age
half
an
hour
of
what
she
said
though
she
guessed
what
holding
your
hand
in
mine
she
was
silent
make
it
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
said
yes
miss
eustacia
i
will
if
i
may
kiss
it
too
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
i
ll
swear
to
do
the
best
i
can
to
let
you
take
my
place
without
anybody
knowing
don
t
you
think
somebody
might
know
your
tongue
miss
it
is
possible
but
i
will
put
a
pebble
in
my
mouth
to
make
is
less
likely
very
well
you
shall
be
allowed
to
have
my
hand
as
soon
as
you
bring
the
dress
and
your
sword
and
staff
i
don
t
want
you
any
longer
now
charley
departed
and
eustacia
felt
more
and
more
interest
in
life
here
was
something
to
do
here
was
some
one
to
see
and
a
charmingly
adventurous
way
to
see
him
ah
she
said
to
herself
want
of
an
object
to
live
for
that
s
all
is
the
matter
with
me
eustacia
s
manner
was
as
a
rule
of
a
slumberous
sort
her
passions
being
of
the
massive
rather
than
the
vivacious
kind
but
when
aroused
she
would
make
a
dash
which
just
for
the
time
was
not
unlike
the
move
of
a
naturally
lively
person
on
the
question
of
recognition
she
was
somewhat
indifferent
by
the
acting
lads
themselves
she
was
not
likely
to
be
known
with
the
guests
who
might
be
assembled
she
was
hardly
so
secure
yet
detection
after
all
would
be
no
such
dreadful
thing
the
fact
only
could
be
detected
her
true
motive
never
it
would
be
instantly
set
down
as
the
passing
freak
of
a
girl
whose
ways
were
already
considered
singular
that
she
was
doing
for
an
earnest
reason
what
would
most
naturally
be
done
in
jest
was
at
any
rate
a
safe
secret
the
next
evening
eustacia
stood
punctually
at
the
fuelhouse
door
waiting
for
the
dusk
which
was
to
bring
charley
with
the
trappings
her
grandfather
was
at
home
tonight
and
she
would
be
unable
to
ask
her
confederate
indoors
he
appeared
on
the
dark
ridge
of
heathland
like
a
fly
on
a
negro
bearing
the
articles
with
him
and
came
up
breathless
with
his
walk
here
are
the
things
he
whispered
placing
them
upon
the
threshold
and
now
miss
eustacia
the
payment
it
is
quite
ready
i
am
as
good
as
my
word
she
leant
against
the
door
post
and
gave
him
her
hand
charley
took
it
in
both
his
own
with
a
tenderness
beyond
description
unless
it
was
like
that
of
a
child
holding
a
captured
sparrow
why
there
s
a
glove
on
it
he
said
in
a
deprecating
way
i
have
been
walking
she
observed
but
miss
well
it
is
hardly
fair
she
pulled
off
the
glove
and
gave
him
her
bare
hand
they
stood
together
minute
after
minute
without
further
speech
each
looking
at
the
blackening
scene
and
each
thinking
his
and
her
own
thoughts
i
think
i
won
t
use
it
all
up
tonight
said
charley
devotedly
when
six
or
eight
minutes
had
been
passed
by
him
caressing
her
hand
may
i
have
the
other
few
minutes
another
time
as
you
like
said
she
without
the
least
emotion
but
it
must
be
over
in
a
week
now
there
is
only
one
thing
i
want
you
to
do
to
wait
while
i
put
on
the
dress
and
then
to
see
if
i
do
my
part
properly
but
let
me
look
first
indoors
she
vanished
for
a
minute
or
two
and
went
in
her
grandfather
was
safely
asleep
in
his
chair
now
then
she
said
on
returning
walk
down
the
garden
a
little
way
and
when
i
am
ready
i
ll
call
you
charley
walked
and
waited
and
presently
heard
a
soft
whistle
he
returned
to
the
fuelhouse
door
did
you
whistle
miss
vye
yes
come
in
reached
him
in
eustacia
s
voice
from
a
back
quarter
i
must
not
strike
a
light
till
the
door
is
shut
or
it
may
be
seen
shining
push
your
hat
into
the
hole
through
to
the
wash
house
if
you
can
feel
your
way
across
charley
did
as
commanded
and
she
struck
the
light
revealing
herself
to
be
changed
in
sex
brilliant
in
colours
and
armed
from
top
to
toe
perhaps
she
quailed
a
little
under
charley
s
vigorous
gaze
but
whether
any
shyness
at
her
male
attire
appeared
upon
her
countenance
could
not
be
seen
by
reason
of
the
strips
of
ribbon
which
used
to
cover
the
face
in
mumming
costumes
representing
the
barred
visor
of
the
mediaeval
helmet
it
fits
pretty
well
she
said
looking
down
at
the
white
overalls
except
that
the
tunic
or
whatever
you
call
it
is
long
in
the
sleeve
the
bottom
of
the
overalls
i
can
turn
up
inside
now
pay
attention
eustacia
then
proceeded
in
her
delivery
striking
the
sword
against
the
staff
or
lance
at
the
minatory
phrases
in
the
orthodox
mumming
manner
and
strutting
up
and
down
charley
seasoned
his
admiration
with
criticism
of
the
gentlest
kind
for
the
touch
of
eustacia
s
hand
yet
remained
with
him
and
now
for
your
excuse
to
the
others
she
said
where
do
you
meet
before
you
go
to
mrs
yeobright
s
we
thought
of
meeting
here
miss
if
you
have
nothing
to
say
against
it
at
eight
o
clock
so
as
to
get
there
by
nine
yes
well
you
of
course
must
not
appear
i
will
march
in
about
five
minutes
late
ready
dressed
and
tell
them
that
you
can
t
come
i
have
decided
that
the
best
plan
will
be
for
you
to
be
sent
somewhere
by
me
to
make
a
real
thing
of
the
excuse
our
two
heath
croppers
are
in
the
habit
of
straying
into
the
meads
and
tomorrow
evening
you
can
go
and
see
if
they
are
gone
there
i
ll
manage
the
rest
now
you
may
leave
me
yes
miss
but
i
think
i
ll
have
one
minute
more
of
what
i
am
owed
if
you
don
t
mind
eustacia
gave
him
her
hand
as
before
one
minute
she
said
and
counted
on
till
she
reached
seven
or
eight
minutes
hand
and
person
she
then
withdrew
to
a
distance
of
several
feet
and
recovered
some
of
her
old
dignity
the
contract
completed
she
raised
between
them
a
barrier
impenetrable
as
a
wall
there
tis
all
gone
and
i
didn
t
mean
quite
all
he
said
with
a
sigh
you
had
good
measure
said
she
turning
away
yes
miss
well
tis
over
and
now
i
ll
get
home
along
through
the
moonlight
the
next
evening
the
mummers
were
assembled
in
the
same
spot
awaiting
the
entrance
of
the
turkish
knight
twenty
minutes
after
eight
by
the
quiet
woman
and
charley
not
come
ten
minutes
past
by
blooms

it
wants
ten
minutes
to
by
grandfer
cantle
s
watch
and
tis
five
minutes
past
by
the
captain
s
clock
on
egdon
there
was
no
absolute
hour
of
the
day
the
time
at
any
moment
was
a
number
of
varying
doctrines
professed
by
the
different
hamlets
some
of
them
having
originally
grown
up
from
a
common
root
and
then
become
divided
by
secession
some
having
been
alien
from
the
beginning
west
egdon
believed
in
blooms
end
time
east
egdon
in
the
time
of
the
quiet
woman
inn
grandfer
cantle
s
watch
had
numbered
many
followers
in
years
gone
by
but
since
he
had
grown
older
faiths
were
shaken
thus
the
mummers
having
gathered
hither
from
scattered
points
each
came
with
his
own
tenets
on
early
and
late
and
they
waited
a
little
longer
as
a
compromise
eustacia
had
watched
the
assemblage
through
the
hole
and
seeing
that
now
was
the
proper
moment
to
enter
she
went
from
the
linhay
and
boldly
pulled
the
bobbin
of
the
fuelhouse
door
her
grandfather
was
safe
at
the
quiet
woman
here
s
charley
at
last
how
late
you
be
charley
tis
not
charley
said
the
turkish
knight
from
within
his
visor
tis
a
cousin
of
miss
vye
s
come
to
take
charley
s
place
from
curiosity
he
was
obliged
to
go
and
look
for
the
heath
croppers
that
have
got
into
the
meads
and
i
agreed
to
take
his
place
as
he
knew
he
couldn
t
come
back
here
again
tonight
i
know
the
part
as
well
as
he
her
graceful
gait
elegant
figure
and
dignified
manner
in
general
won
the
mummers
to
the
opinion
that
they
had
gained
by
the
exchange
if
the
newcomer
were
perfect
in
his
part
it
don
t
matter
if
you
be
not
too
young
said
saint
george
eustacia
s
voice
had
sounded
somewhat
more
juvenile
and
fluty
than
charley
s
i
know
every
word
of
it
i
tell
you
said
eustacia
decisively
dash
being
all
that
was
required
to
carry
her
triumphantly
through
she
adopted
as
much
as
was
necessary
go
ahead
lads
with
the
try
over
i
ll
challenge
any
of
you
to
find
a
mistake
in
me
the
play
was
hastily
rehearsed
whereupon
the
other
mummers
were
delighted
with
the
new
knight
they
extinguished
the
candles
at
half
past
eight
and
set
out
upon
the
heath
in
the
direction
of
mrs
yeobright
s
house
at
bloom
s
end
there
was
a
slight
hoarfrost
that
night
and
the
moon
though
not
more
than
half
full
threw
a
spirited
and
enticing
brightness
upon
the
fantastic
figures
of
the
mumming
band
whose
plumes
and
ribbons
rustled
in
their
walk
like
autumn
leaves
their
path
was
not
over
rainbarrow
now
but
down
a
valley
which
left
that
ancient
elevation
a
little
to
the
east
the
bottom
of
the
vale
was
green
to
a
width
of
ten
yards
or
thereabouts
and
the
shining
facets
of
frost
upon
the
blades
of
grass
seemed
to
move
on
with
the
shadows
of
those
they
surrounded
the
masses
of
furze
and
heath
to
the
right
and
left
were
dark
as
ever
a
mere
half
moon
was
powerless
to
silver
such
sable
features
as
theirs
half
an
hour
of
walking
and
talking
brought
them
to
the
spot
in
the
valley
where
the
grass
riband
widened
and
led
down
to
the
front
of
the
house
at
sight
of
the
place
eustacia
who
had
felt
a
few
passing
doubts
during
her
walk
with
the
youths
again
was
glad
that
the
adventure
had
been
undertaken
she
had
come
out
to
see
a
man
who
might
possibly
have
the
power
to
deliver
her
soul
from
a
most
deadly
oppression
what
was
wildeve
interesting
but
inadequate
perhaps
she
would
see
a
sufficient
hero
tonight
as
they
drew
nearer
to
the
front
of
the
house
the
mummers
became
aware
that
music
and
dancing
were
briskly
flourishing
within
every
now
and
then
a
long
low
note
from
the
serpent
which
was
the
chief
wind
instrument
played
at
these
times
advanced
further
into
the
heath
than
the
thin
treble
part
and
reached
their
ears
alone
and
next
a
more
than
usual
loud
tread
from
a
dancer
would
come
the
same
way
with
nearer
approach
these
fragmentary
sounds
became
pieced
together
and
were
found
to
be
the
salient
points
of
the
tune
called
nancy
s
fancy
he
was
there
of
course
who
was
she
that
he
danced
with
perhaps
some
unknown
woman
far
beneath
herself
in
culture
was
by
the
most
subtle
of
lures
sealing
his
fate
this
very
instant
to
dance
with
a
man
is
to
concentrate
a
twelvemonth
s
regulation
fire
upon
him
in
the
fragment
of
an
hour
to
pass
to
courtship
without
acquaintance
to
pass
to
marriage
without
courtship
is
a
skipping
of
terms
reserved
for
those
alone
who
tread
this
royal
road
she
would
see
how
his
heart
lay
by
keen
observation
of
them
all
the
enterprising
lady
followed
the
mumming
company
through
the
gate
in
the
white
paling
and
stood
before
the
open
porch
the
house
was
encrusted
with
heavy
thatchings
which
dropped
between
the
upper
windows
the
front
upon
which
the
moonbeams
directly
played
had
originally
been
white
but
a
huge
pyracanth
now
darkened
the
greater
portion
it
became
at
once
evident
that
the
dance
was
proceeding
immediately
within
the
surface
of
the
door
no
apartment
intervening
the
brushing
of
skirts
and
elbows
sometimes
the
bumping
of
shoulders
could
be
heard
against
the
very
panels
eustacia
though
living
within
two
miles
of
the
place
had
never
seen
the
interior
of
this
quaint
old
habitation
between
captain
vye
and
the
yeobrights
there
had
never
existed
much
acquaintance
the
former
having
come
as
a
stranger
and
purchased
the
long
empty
house
at
mistover
knap
not
long
before
the
death
of
mrs
yeobright
s
husband
and
with
that
event
and
the
departure
of
her
son
such
friendship
as
had
grown
up
became
quite
broken
off
is
there
no
passage
inside
the
door
then
asked
eustacia
as
they
stood
within
the
porch
no
said
the
lad
who
played
the
saracen
the
door
opens
right
upon
the
front
sitting
room
where
the
spree
s
going
on
so
that
we
cannot
open
the
door
without
stopping
the
dance
that
s
it
here
we
must
bide
till
they
have
done
for
they
always
bolt
the
back
door
after
dark
they
won
t
be
much
longer
said
father
christmas
this
assertion
however
was
hardly
borne
out
by
the
event
again
the
instruments
ended
the
tune
again
they
recommenced
with
as
much
fire
and
pathos
as
if
it
were
the
first
strain
the
air
was
now
that
one
without
any
particular
beginning
middle
or
end
which
perhaps
among
all
the
dances
which
throng
an
inspired
fiddler
s
fancy
best
conveys
the
idea
of
the
interminable
the
celebrated
devil
s
dream
the
fury
of
personal
movement
that
was
kindled
by
the
fury
of
the
notes
could
be
approximately
imagined
by
these
outsiders
under
the
moon
from
the
occasional
kicks
of
toes
and
heels
against
the
door
whenever
the
whirl
round
had
been
of
more
than
customary
velocity
the
first
five
minutes
of
listening
was
interesting
enough
to
the
mummers
the
five
minutes
extended
to
ten
minutes
and
these
to
a
quarter
of
an
hour
but
no
signs
of
ceasing
were
audible
in
the
lively
dream
the
bumping
against
the
door
the
laughter
the
stamping
were
all
as
vigorous
as
ever
and
the
pleasure
in
being
outside
lessened
considerably
why
does
mrs
yeobright
give
parties
of
this
sort
eustacia
asked
a
little
surprised
to
hear
merriment
so
pronounced
it
is
not
one
of
her
bettermost
parlour
parties
she
s
asked
the
plain
neighbours
and
workpeople
without
drawing
any
lines
just
to
give
em
a
good
supper
and
such
like
her
son
and
she
wait
upon
the
folks
i
see
said
eustacia
tis
the
last
strain
i
think
said
saint
george
with
his
ear
to
the
panel
a
young
man
and
woman
have
just
swung
into
this
corner
and
he
s
saying
to
her
ah
the
pity
tis
over
for
us
this
time
my
own
thank
god
said
the
turkish
knight
stamping
and
taking
from
the
wall
the
conventional
lance
that
each
of
the
mummers
carried
her
boots
being
thinner
than
those
of
the
young
men
the
hoar
had
damped
her
feet
and
made
them
cold
upon
my
song
tis
another
ten
minutes
for
us
said
the
valiant
soldier
looking
through
the
keyhole
as
the
tune
modulated
into
another
without
stopping
grandfer
cantle
is
standing
in
this
corner
waiting
his
turn
twon
t
be
long
tis
a
six
handed
reel
said
the
doctor
why
not
go
in
dancing
or
no
they
sent
for
us
said
the
saracen
certainly
not
said
eustacia
authoritatively
as
she
paced
smartly
up
and
down
from
door
to
gate
to
warm
herself
we
should
burst
into
the
middle
of
them
and
stop
the
dance
and
that
would
be
unmannerly
he
thinks
himself
somebody
because
he
has
had
a
bit
more
schooling
than
we
said
the
doctor
you
may
go
to
the
deuce
said
eustacia
there
was
a
whispered
conversation
between
three
or
four
of
them
and
one
turned
to
her
will
you
tell
us
one
thing
he
said
not
without
gentleness
be
you
miss
vye
we
think
you
must
be
you
may
think
what
you
like
said
eustacia
slowly
but
honourable
lads
will
not
tell
tales
upon
a
lady
we
ll
say
nothing
miss
that
s
upon
our
honour
thank
you
she
replied
at
this
moment
the
fiddles
finished
off
with
a
screech
and
the
serpent
emitted
a
last
note
that
nearly
lifted
the
roof
when
from
the
comparative
quiet
within
the
mummers
judged
that
the
dancers
had
taken
their
seats
father
christmas
advanced
lifted
the
latch
and
put
his
head
inside
the
door
ah
the
mummers
the
mummers
cried
several
guests
at
once
clear
a
space
for
the
mummers
humpbacked
father
christmas
then
made
a
complete
entry
swinging
his
huge
club
and
in
a
general
way
clearing
the
stage
for
the
actors
proper
while
he
informed
the
company
in
smart
verse
that
he
was
come
welcome
or
welcome
not
concluding
his
speech
with
make
room
make
room
my
gallant
boys
and
give
us
space
to
rhyme
we
ve
come
to
show
saint
george
s
play
upon
this
christmas
time
the
guests
were
now
arranging
themselves
at
one
end
of
the
room
the
fiddler
was
mending
a
string
the
serpent
player
was
emptying
his
mouthpiece
and
the
play
began
first
of
those
outside
the
valiant
soldier
entered
in
the
interest
of
saint
george
here
come
i
the
valiant
soldier
slasher
is
my
name
and
so
on
this
speech
concluded
with
a
challenge
to
the
infidel
at
the
end
of
which
it
was
eustacia
s
duty
to
enter
as
the
turkish
knight
she
with
the
rest
who
were
not
yet
on
had
hitherto
remained
in
the
moonlight
which
streamed
under
the
porch
with
no
apparent
effort
or
backwardness
she
came
in
beginning
here
come
i
a
turkish
knight
who
learnt
in
turkish
land
to
fight
i
ll
fight
this
man
with
courage
bold
if
his
blood
s
hot
i
ll
make
it
cold
during
her
declamation
eustacia
held
her
head
erect
and
spoke
as
roughly
as
she
could
feeling
pretty
secure
from
observation
but
the
concentration
upon
her
part
necessary
to
prevent
discovery
the
newness
of
the
scene
the
shine
of
the
candles
and
the
confusing
effect
upon
her
vision
of
the
ribboned
visor
which
hid
her
features
left
her
absolutely
unable
to
perceive
who
were
present
as
spectators
on
the
further
side
of
a
table
bearing
candles
she
could
faintly
discern
faces
and
that
was
all
meanwhile
jim
starks
as
the
valiant
soldier
had
come
forward
and
with
a
glare
upon
the
turk
replied
if
then
thou
art
that
turkish
knight
draw
out
thy
sword
and
let
us
fight
and
fight
they
did
the
issue
of
the
combat
being
that
the
valiant
soldier
was
slain
by
a
preternaturally
inadequate
thrust
from
eustacia
jim
in
his
ardour
for
genuine
histrionic
art
coming
down
like
a
log
upon
the
stone
floor
with
force
enough
to
dislocate
his
shoulder
then
after
more
words
from
the
turkish
knight
rather
too
faintly
delivered
and
statements
that
he
d
fight
saint
george
and
all
his
crew
saint
george
himself
magnificently
entered
with
the
well
known
flourish
here
come
i
saint
george
the
valiant
man
with
naked
sword
and
spear
in
hand
who
fought
the
dragon
and
brought
him
to
the
slaughter
and
by
this
won
fair
sabra
the
king
of
egypt
s
daughter
what
mortal
man
would
dare
to
stand
before
me
with
my
sword
in
hand
this
was
the
lad
who
had
first
recognized
eustacia
and
when
she
now
as
the
turk
replied
with
suitable
defiance
and
at
once
began
the
combat
the
young
fellow
took
especial
care
to
use
his
sword
as
gently
as
possible
being
wounded
the
knight
fell
upon
one
knee
according
to
the
direction
the
doctor
now
entered
restored
the
knight
by
giving
him
a
draught
from
the
bottle
which
he
carried
and
the
fight
was
again
resumed
the
turk
sinking
by
degrees
until
quite
overcome
dying
as
hard
in
this
venerable
drama
as
he
is
said
to
do
at
the
present
day
this
gradual
sinking
to
the
earth
was
in
fact
one
reason
why
eustacia
had
thought
that
the
part
of
the
turkish
knight
though
not
the
shortest
would
suit
her
best
a
direct
fall
from
upright
to
horizontal
which
was
the
end
of
the
other
fighting
characters
was
not
an
elegant
or
decorous
part
for
a
girl
but
it
was
easy
to
die
like
a
turk
by
a
dogged
decline
eustacia
was
now
among
the
number
of
the
slain
though
not
on
the
floor
for
she
had
managed
to
sink
into
a
sloping
position
against
the
clock
case
so
that
her
head
was
well
elevated
the
play
proceeded
between
saint
george
the
saracen
the
doctor
and
father
christmas
and
eustacia
having
no
more
to
do
for
the
first
time
found
leisure
to
observe
the
scene
round
and
to
search
for
the
form
that
had
drawn
her
hither
the
two
stand
face
to
face
the
room
had
been
arranged
with
a
view
to
the
dancing
the
large
oak
table
having
been
moved
back
till
it
stood
as
a
breastwork
to
the
fireplace
at
each
end
behind
and
in
the
chimney
corner
were
grouped
the
guests
many
of
them
being
warm
faced
and
panting
among
whom
eustacia
cursorily
recognized
some
well
to
do
persons
from
beyond
the
heath
thomasin
as
she
had
expected
was
not
visible
and
eustacia
recollected
that
a
light
had
shone
from
an
upper
window
when
they
were
outside
the
window
probably
of
thomasin
s
room
a
nose
chin
hands
knees
and
toes
projected
from
the
seat
within
the
chimney
opening
which
members
she
found
to
unite
in
the
person
of
grandfer
cantle
mrs
yeobright
s
occasional
assistant
in
the
garden
and
therefore
one
of
the
invited
the
smoke
went
up
from
an
etna
of
peat
in
front
of
him
played
round
the
notches
of
the
chimney
crook
struck
against
the
salt
box
and
got
lost
among
the
flitches
another
part
of
the
room
soon
riveted
her
gaze
at
the
other
side
of
the
chimney
stood
the
settle
which
is
the
necessary
supplement
to
a
fire
so
open
that
nothing
less
than
a
strong
breeze
will
carry
up
the
smoke
it
is
to
the
hearths
of
old
fashioned
cavernous
fireplaces
what
the
east
belt
of
trees
is
to
the
exposed
country
estate
or
the
north
wall
to
the
garden
outside
the
settle
candles
gutter
locks
of
hair
wave
young
women
shiver
and
old
men
sneeze
inside
is
paradise
not
a
symptom
of
a
draught
disturbs
the
air
the
sitters
backs
are
as
warm
as
their
faces
and
songs
and
old
tales
are
drawn
from
the
occupants
by
the
comfortable
heat
like
fruit
from
melon
plants
in
a
frame
it
was
however
not
with
those
who
sat
in
the
settle
that
eustacia
was
concerned
a
face
showed
itself
with
marked
distinctness
against
the
dark
tanned
wood
of
the
upper
part
the
owner
who
was
leaning
against
the
settle
s
outer
end
was
clement
yeobright
or
clym
as
he
was
called
here
she
knew
it
could
be
nobody
else
the
spectacle
constituted
an
area
of
two
feet
in
rembrandt
s
intensest
manner
a
strange
power
in
the
lounger
s
appearance
lay
in
the
fact
that
though
his
whole
figure
was
visible
the
observer
s
eye
was
only
aware
of
his
face
to
one
of
middle
age
the
countenance
was
that
of
a
young
man
though
a
youth
might
hardly
have
seen
any
necessity
for
the
term
of
immaturity
but
it
was
really
one
of
those
faces
which
convey
less
the
idea
of
so
many
years
as
its
age
than
of
so
much
experience
as
its
store
the
number
of
their
years
may
have
adequately
summed
up
jared
mahalaleel
and
the
rest
of
the
antediluvians
but
the
age
of
a
modern
man
is
to
be
measured
by
the
intensity
of
his
history
the
face
was
well
shaped
even
excellently
but
the
mind
within
was
beginning
to
use
it
as
a
mere
waste
tablet
whereon
to
trace
its
idiosyncrasies
as
they
developed
themselves
the
beauty
here
visible
would
in
no
long
time
be
ruthlessly
over
run
by
its
parasite
thought
which
might
just
as
well
have
fed
upon
a
plainer
exterior
where
there
was
nothing
it
could
harm
had
heaven
preserved
yeobright
from
a
wearing
habit
of
meditation
people
would
have
said
a
handsome
man
had
his
brain
unfolded
under
sharper
contours
they
would
have
said
a
thoughtful
man
but
an
inner
strenuousness
was
preying
upon
an
outer
symmetry
and
they
rated
his
look
as
singular
hence
people
who
began
by
beholding
him
ended
by
perusing
him
his
countenance
was
overlaid
with
legible
meanings
without
being
thought
worn
he
yet
had
certain
marks
derived
from
a
perception
of
his
surroundings
such
as
are
not
unfrequently
found
on
men
at
the
end
of
the
four
or
five
years
of
endeavour
which
follow
the
close
of
placid
pupilage
he
already
showed
that
thought
is
a
disease
of
flesh
and
indirectly
bore
evidence
that
ideal
physical
beauty
is
incompatible
with
emotional
development
and
a
full
recognition
of
the
coil
of
things
mental
luminousness
must
be
fed
with
the
oil
of
life
even
though
there
is
already
a
physical
need
for
it
and
the
pitiful
sight
of
two
demands
on
one
supply
was
just
showing
itself
here
when
standing
before
certain
men
the
philosopher
regrets
that
thinkers
are
but
perishable
tissue
the
artist
that
perishable
tissue
has
to
think
thus
to
deplore
each
from
his
point
of
view
the
mutually
destructive
interdependence
of
spirit
and
flesh
would
have
been
instinctive
with
these
in
critically
observing
yeobright
as
for
his
look
it
was
a
natural
cheerfulness
striving
against
depression
from
without
and
not
quite
succeeding
the
look
suggested
isolation
but
it
revealed
something
more
as
is
usual
with
bright
natures
the
deity
that
lies
ignominiously
chained
within
an
ephemeral
human
carcase
shone
out
of
him
like
a
ray
the
effect
upon
eustacia
was
palpable
the
extraordinary
pitch
of
excitement
that
she
had
reached
beforehand
would
indeed
have
caused
her
to
be
influenced
by
the
most
commonplace
man
she
was
troubled
at
yeobright
s
presence
the
remainder
of
the
play
ended
the
saracen
s
head
was
cut
off
and
saint
george
stood
as
victor
nobody
commented
any
more
than
they
would
have
commented
on
the
fact
of
mushrooms
coming
in
autumn
or
snowdrops
in
spring
they
took
the
piece
as
phlegmatically
as
did
the
actors
themselves
it
was
a
phase
of
cheerfulness
which
was
as
a
matter
of
course
to
be
passed
through
every
christmas
and
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
they
sang
the
plaintive
chant
which
follows
the
play
during
which
all
the
dead
men
rise
to
their
feet
in
a
silent
and
awful
manner
like
the
ghosts
of
napoleon
s
soldiers
in
the
midnight
review
afterwards
the
door
opened
and
fairway
appeared
on
the
threshold
accompanied
by
christian
and
another
they
had
been
waiting
outside
for
the
conclusion
of
the
play
as
the
players
had
waited
for
the
conclusion
of
the
dance
come
in
come
in
said
mrs
yeobright
and
clym
went
forward
to
welcome
them
how
is
it
you
are
so
late
grandfer
cantle
has
been
here
ever
so
long
and
we
thought
you
d
have
come
with
him
as
you
live
so
near
one
another
well
i
should
have
come
earlier
mr
fairway
said
and
paused
to
look
along
the
beam
of
the
ceiling
for
a
nail
to
hang
his
hat
on
but
finding
his
accustomed
one
to
be
occupied
by
the
mistletoe
and
all
the
nails
in
the
walls
to
be
burdened
with
bunches
of
holly
he
at
last
relieved
himself
of
the
hat
by
ticklishly
balancing
it
between
the
candle
box
and
the
head
of
the
clock
case
i
should
have
come
earlier
ma
am
he
resumed
with
a
more
composed
air
but
i
know
what
parties
be
and
how
there
s
none
too
much
room
in
folks
houses
at
such
times
so
i
thought
i
wouldn
t
come
till
you
d
got
settled
a
bit
and
i
thought
so
too
mrs
yeobright
said
christian
earnestly
but
father
there
was
so
eager
that
he
had
no
manners
at
all
and
left
home
almost
afore
twas
dark
i
told
him
twas
barely
decent
in
a
old
man
to
come
so
oversoon
but
words
be
wind
klk
i
wasn
t
going
to
bide
waiting
about
till
half
the
game
was
over
i
m
as
light
as
a
kite
when
anything
s
going
on
crowed
grandfer
cantle
from
the
chimneyseat
fairway
had
meanwhile
concluded
a
critical
gaze
at
yeobright
now
you
may
not
believe
it
he
said
to
the
rest
of
the
room
but
i
should
never
have
knowed
this
gentleman
if
i
had
met
him
anywhere
off
his
own
he
th
he
s
altered
so
much
you
too
have
altered
and
for
the
better
i
think
timothy
said
yeobright
surveying
the
firm
figure
of
fairway
master
yeobright
look
me
over
too
i
have
altered
for
the
better
haven
t
i
hey
said
grandfer
cantle
rising
and
placing
himself
something
above
half
a
foot
from
clym
s
eye
to
induce
the
most
searching
criticism
to
be
sure
we
will
said
fairway
taking
the
candle
and
moving
it
over
the
surface
of
the
grandfer
s
countenance
the
subject
of
his
scrutiny
irradiating
himself
with
light
and
pleasant
smiles
and
giving
himself
jerks
of
juvenility
you
haven
t
changed
much
said
yeobright
if
there
s
any
difference
grandfer
is
younger
appended
fairway
decisively
and
yet
not
my
own
doing
and
i
feel
no
pride
in
it
said
the
pleased
ancient
but
i
can
t
be
cured
of
my
vagaries
them
i
plead
guilty
to
yes
master
cantle
always
was
that
as
we
know
but
i
am
nothing
by
the
side
of
you
mister
clym
nor
any
o
us
said
humphrey
in
a
low
rich
tone
of
admiration
not
intended
to
reach
anybody
s
ears
really
there
would
have
been
nobody
here
who
could
have
stood
as
decent
second
to
him
or
even
third
if
i
hadn
t
been
a
soldier
in
the
bang
up
locals
as
we
was
called
for
our
smartness
said
grandfer
cantle
and
even
as
tis
we
all
look
a
little
scammish
beside
him
but
in
the
year
four
twas
said
there
wasn
t
a
finer
figure
in
the
whole
south
wessex
than
i
as
i
looked
when
dashing
past
the
shop
winders
with
the
rest
of
our
company
on
the
day
we
ran
out
o
budmouth
because
it
was
thoughted
that
boney
had
landed
round
the
point
there
was
i
straight
as
a
young
poplar
wi
my
firelock
and
my
bagnet
and
my
spatterdashes
and
my
stock
sawing
my
jaws
off
and
my
accoutrements
sheening
like
the
seven
stars
yes
neighbours
i
was
a
pretty
sight
in
my
soldiering
days
you
ought
to
have
seen
me
in
four
tis
his
mother
s
side
where
master
clym
s
figure
comes
from
bless
ye
said
timothy
i
know
d
her
brothers
well
longer
coffins
were
never
made
in
the
whole
country
of
south
wessex
and
tis
said
that
poor
george
s
knees
were
crumpled
up
a
little
e
en
as
twas
coffins
where
inquired
christian
drawing
nearer
have
the
ghost
of
one
appeared
to
anybody
master
fairway
no
no
don
t
let
your
mind
so
mislead
your
ears
christian
and
be
a
man
said
timothy
reproachfully
i
will
said
christian
but
now
i
think
o
t
my
shadder
last
night
seemed
just
the
shape
of
a
coffin
what
is
it
a
sign
of
when
your
shade
s
like
a
coffin
neighbours
it
can
t
be
nothing
to
be
afeared
of
i
suppose
afeared
no
said
the
grandfer
faith
i
was
never
afeard
of
nothing
except
boney
or
i
shouldn
t
ha
been
the
soldier
i
was
yes
tis
a
thousand
pities
you
didn
t
see
me
in
four
by
this
time
the
mummers
were
preparing
to
leave
but
mrs
yeobright
stopped
them
by
asking
them
to
sit
down
and
have
a
little
supper
to
this
invitation
father
christmas
in
the
name
of
them
all
readily
agreed
eustacia
was
happy
in
the
opportunity
of
staying
a
little
longer
the
cold
and
frosty
night
without
was
doubly
frigid
to
her
but
the
lingering
was
not
without
its
difficulties
mrs
yeobright
for
want
of
room
in
the
larger
apartment
placed
a
bench
for
the
mummers
halfway
through
the
pantry
door
which
opened
from
the
sitting
room
here
they
seated
themselves
in
a
row
the
door
being
left
open
thus
they
were
still
virtually
in
the
same
apartment
mrs
yeobright
now
murmured
a
few
words
to
her
son
who
crossed
the
room
to
the
pantry
door
striking
his
head
against
the
mistletoe
as
he
passed
and
brought
the
mummers
beef
and
bread
cake
pastry
mead
and
elder
wine
the
waiting
being
done
by
him
and
his
mother
that
the
little
maid
servant
might
sit
as
guest
the
mummers
doffed
their
helmets
and
began
to
eat
and
drink
but
you
will
surely
have
some
said
clym
to
the
turkish
knight
as
he
stood
before
that
warrior
tray
in
hand
she
had
refused
and
still
sat
covered
only
the
sparkle
of
her
eyes
being
visible
between
the
ribbons
which
covered
her
face
none
thank
you
replied
eustacia
he
s
quite
a
youngster
said
the
saracen
apologetically
and
you
must
excuse
him
he
s
not
one
of
the
old
set
but
have
jined
us
because
t
other
couldn
t
come
but
he
will
take
something
persisted
yeobright
try
a
glass
of
mead
or
elder
wine
yes
you
had
better
try
that
said
the
saracen
it
will
keep
the
cold
out
going
home
along
though
eustacia
could
not
eat
without
uncovering
her
face
she
could
drink
easily
enough
beneath
her
disguise
the
elder
wine
was
accordingly
accepted
and
the
glass
vanished
inside
the
ribbons
at
moments
during
this
performance
eustacia
was
half
in
doubt
about
the
security
of
her
position
yet
it
had
a
fearful
joy
a
series
of
attentions
paid
to
her
and
yet
not
to
her
but
to
some
imaginary
person
by
the
first
man
she
had
ever
been
inclined
to
adore
complicated
her
emotions
indescribably
she
had
loved
him
partly
because
he
was
exceptional
in
this
scene
partly
because
she
had
determined
to
love
him
chiefly
because
she
was
in
desperate
need
of
loving
somebody
after
wearying
of
wildeve
believing
that
she
must
love
him
in
spite
of
herself
she
had
been
influenced
after
the
fashion
of
the
second
lord
lyttleton
and
other
persons
who
have
dreamed
that
they
were
to
die
on
a
certain
day
and
by
stress
of
a
morbid
imagination
have
actually
brought
about
that
event
once
let
a
maiden
admit
the
possibility
of
her
being
stricken
with
love
for
someone
at
a
certain
hour
and
place
and
the
thing
is
as
good
as
done
did
anything
at
this
moment
suggest
to
yeobright
the
sex
of
the
creature
whom
that
fantastic
guise
inclosed
how
extended
was
her
scope
both
in
feeling
and
in
making
others
feel
and
how
far
her
compass
transcended
that
of
her
companions
in
the
band
when
the
disguised
queen
of
love
appeared
before
aeneas
a
preternatural
perfume
accompanied
her
presence
and
betrayed
her
quality
if
such
a
mysterious
emanation
ever
was
projected
by
the
emotions
of
an
earthly
woman
upon
their
object
it
must
have
signified
eustacia
s
presence
to
yeobright
now
he
looked
at
her
wistfully
then
seemed
to
fall
into
a
reverie
as
if
he
were
forgetting
what
he
observed
the
momentary
situation
ended
he
passed
on
and
eustacia
sipped
her
wine
without
knowing
what
she
drank
the
man
for
whom
she
had
pre
determined
to
nourish
a
passion
went
into
the
small
room
and
across
it
to
the
further
extremity
the
mummers
as
has
been
stated
were
seated
on
a
bench
one
end
of
which
extended
into
the
small
apartment
or
pantry
for
want
of
space
in
the
outer
room
eustacia
partly
from
shyness
had
chosen
the
midmost
seat
which
thus
commanded
a
view
of
the
interior
of
the
pantry
as
well
as
the
room
containing
the
guests
when
clym
passed
down
the
pantry
her
eyes
followed
him
in
the
gloom
which
prevailed
there
at
the
remote
end
was
a
door
which
just
as
he
was
about
to
open
it
for
himself
was
opened
by
somebody
within
and
light
streamed
forth
the
person
was
thomasin
with
a
candle
looking
anxious
pale
and
interesting
yeobright
appeared
glad
to
see
her
and
pressed
her
hand
that
s
right
tamsie
he
said
heartily
as
though
recalled
to
himself
by
the
sight
of
her
you
have
decided
to
come
down
i
am
glad
of
it
hush
no
no
she
said
quickly
i
only
came
to
speak
to
you
but
why
not
join
us
i
cannot
at
least
i
would
rather
not
i
am
not
well
enough
and
we
shall
have
plenty
of
time
together
now
you
are
going
to
be
home
a
good
long
holiday
it
isn
t
nearly
so
pleasant
without
you
are
you
really
ill
just
a
little
my
old
cousin
here
she
said
playfully
sweeping
her
hand
across
her
heart
ah
mother
should
have
asked
somebody
else
to
be
present
tonight
perhaps
o
no
indeed
i
merely
stepped
down
clym
to
ask
you
here
he
followed
her
through
the
doorway
into
the
private
room
beyond
and
the
door
closing
eustacia
and
the
mummer
who
sat
next
to
her
the
only
other
witness
of
the
performance
saw
and
heard
no
more
the
heat
flew
to
eustacia
s
head
and
cheeks
she
instantly
guessed
that
clym
having
been
home
only
these
two
or
three
days
had
not
as
yet
been
made
acquainted
with
thomasin
s
painful
situation
with
regard
to
wildeve
and
seeing
her
living
there
just
as
she
had
been
living
before
he
left
home
he
naturally
suspected
nothing
eustacia
felt
a
wild
jealousy
of
thomasin
on
the
instant
though
thomasin
might
possibly
have
tender
sentiments
towards
another
man
as
yet
how
long
could
they
be
expected
to
last
when
she
was
shut
up
here
with
this
interesting
and
travelled
cousin
of
hers
there
was
no
knowing
what
affection
might
not
soon
break
out
between
the
two
so
constantly
in
each
other
s
society
and
not
a
distracting
object
near
clym
s
boyish
love
for
her
might
have
languished
but
it
might
easily
be
revived
again
eustacia
was
nettled
by
her
own
contrivances
what
a
sheer
waste
of
herself
to
be
dressed
thus
while
another
was
shining
to
advantage
had
she
known
the
full
effect
of
the
encounter
she
would
have
moved
heaven
and
earth
to
get
here
in
a
natural
manner
the
power
of
her
face
all
lost
the
charm
of
her
emotions
all
disguised
the
fascinations
of
her
coquetry
denied
existence
nothing
but
a
voice
left
to
her
she
had
a
sense
of
the
doom
of
echo
nobody
here
respects
me
she
said
she
had
overlooked
the
fact
that
in
coming
as
a
boy
among
other
boys
she
would
be
treated
as
a
boy
the
slight
though
of
her
own
causing
and
self
explanatory
she
was
unable
to
dismiss
as
unwittingly
shown
so
sensitive
had
the
situation
made
her
women
have
done
much
for
themselves
in
histrionic
dress
to
look
far
below
those
who
like
a
certain
fair
personator
of
polly
peachum
early
in
the
last
century
and
another
of
lydia
languish
early
in
this
have
won
not
only
love
but
ducal
coronets
into
the
bargain
whole
shoals
of
them
have
reached
to
the
initial
satisfaction
of
getting
love
almost
whence
they
would
but
the
turkish
knight
was
denied
even
the
chance
of
achieving
this
by
the
fluttering
ribbons
which
she
dared
not
brush
aside
written
in
yeobright
returned
to
the
room
without
his
cousin
when
within
two
or
three
feet
of
eustacia
he
stopped
as
if
again
arrested
by
a
thought
he
was
gazing
at
her
she
looked
another
way
disconcerted
and
wondered
how
long
this
purgatory
was
to
last
after
lingering
a
few
seconds
he
passed
on
again
to
court
their
own
discomfiture
by
love
is
a
common
instinct
with
certain
perfervid
women
conflicting
sensations
of
love
fear
and
shame
reduced
eustacia
to
a
state
of
the
utmost
uneasiness
to
escape
was
her
great
and
immediate
desire
the
other
mummers
appeared
to
be
in
no
hurry
to
leave
and
murmuring
to
the
lad
who
sat
next
to
her
that
she
preferred
waiting
for
them
outside
the
house
she
moved
to
the
door
as
imperceptibly
as
possible
opened
it
and
slipped
out
the
calm
lone
scene
reassured
her
she
went
forward
to
the
palings
and
leant
over
them
looking
at
the
moon
she
had
stood
thus
but
a
little
time
when
the
door
again
opened
expecting
to
see
the
remainder
of
the
band
eustacia
turned
but
no
clym
yeobright
came
out
as
softly
as
she
had
done
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
he
advanced
and
stood
beside
her
i
have
an
odd
opinion
he
said
and
should
like
to
ask
you
a
question
are
you
a
woman
or
am
i
wrong
i
am
a
woman
his
eyes
lingered
on
her
with
great
interest
do
girls
often
play
as
mummers
now
they
never
used
to
they
don
t
now
why
did
you
to
get
excitement
and
shake
off
depression
she
said
in
low
tones
what
depressed
you
life
that
s
a
cause
of
depression
a
good
many
have
to
put
up
with
yes
a
long
silence
and
do
you
find
excitement
asked
clym
at
last
at
this
moment
perhaps
then
you
are
vexed
at
being
discovered
yes
though
i
thought
i
might
be
i
would
gladly
have
asked
you
to
our
party
had
i
known
you
wished
to
come
have
i
ever
been
acquainted
with
you
in
my
youth
never
won
t
you
come
in
again
and
stay
as
long
as
you
like
no
i
wish
not
to
be
further
recognized
well
you
are
safe
with
me
after
remaining
in
thought
a
minute
he
added
gently
i
will
not
intrude
upon
you
longer
it
is
a
strange
way
of
meeting
and
i
will
not
ask
why
i
find
a
cultivated
woman
playing
such
a
part
as
this
she
did
not
volunteer
the
reason
which
he
seemed
to
hope
for
and
he
wished
her
good
night
going
thence
round
to
the
back
of
the
house
where
he
walked
up
and
down
by
himself
for
some
time
before
re
entering
eustacia
warmed
with
an
inner
fire
could
not
wait
for
her
companions
after
this
she
flung
back
the
ribbons
from
her
face
opened
the
gate
and
at
once
struck
into
the
heath
she
did
not
hasten
along
her
grandfather
was
in
bed
at
this
hour
for
she
so
frequently
walked
upon
the
hills
on
moonlight
nights
that
he
took
no
notice
of
her
comings
and
goings
and
enjoying
himself
in
his
own
way
left
her
to
do
likewise
a
more
important
subject
than
that
of
getting
indoors
now
engrossed
her
yeobright
if
he
had
the
least
curiosity
would
infallibly
discover
her
name
what
then
she
first
felt
a
sort
of
exultation
at
the
way
in
which
the
adventure
had
terminated
even
though
at
moments
between
her
exultations
she
was
abashed
and
blushful
then
this
consideration
recurred
to
chill
her
what
was
the
use
of
her
exploit
she
was
at
present
a
total
stranger
to
the
yeobright
family
the
unreasonable
nimbus
of
romance
with
which
she
had
encircled
that
man
might
be
her
misery
how
could
she
allow
herself
to
become
so
infatuated
with
a
stranger
and
to
fill
the
cup
of
her
sorrow
there
would
be
thomasin
living
day
after
day
in
inflammable
proximity
to
him
for
she
had
just
learnt
that
contrary
to
her
first
belief
he
was
going
to
stay
at
home
some
considerable
time
she
reached
the
wicket
at
mistover
knap
but
before
opening
it
she
turned
and
faced
the
heath
once
more
the
form
of
rainbarrow
stood
above
the
hills
and
the
moon
stood
above
rainbarrow
the
air
was
charged
with
silence
and
frost
the
scene
reminded
eustacia
of
a
circumstance
which
till
that
moment
she
had
totally
forgotten
she
had
promised
to
meet
wildeve
by
the
barrow
this
very
night
at
eight
to
give
a
final
answer
to
his
pleading
for
an
elopement
she
herself
had
fixed
the
evening
and
the
hour
he
had
probably
come
to
the
spot
waited
there
in
the
cold
and
been
greatly
disappointed
well
so
much
the
better
it
did
not
hurt
him
she
said
serenely
wildeve
had
at
present
the
rayless
outline
of
the
sun
through
smoked
glass
and
she
could
say
such
things
as
that
with
the
greatest
facility
she
remained
deeply
pondering
and
thomasin
s
winning
manner
towards
her
cousin
arose
again
upon
eustacia
s
mind
o
that
she
had
been
married
to
damon
before
this
she
said
and
she
would
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
me
if
i
had
only
known
if
i
had
only
known
eustacia
once
more
lifted
her
deep
stormy
eyes
to
the
moonlight
and
sighing
that
tragic
sigh
of
hers
which
was
so
much
like
a
shudder
entered
the
shadow
of
the
roof
she
threw
off
her
trappings
in
the
outhouse
rolled
them
up
and
went
indoors
to
her
chamber
a
coalition
between
beauty
and
oddness
the
old
captain
s
prevailing
indifference
to
his
granddaughter
s
movements
left
her
free
as
a
bird
to
follow
her
own
courses
but
it
so
happened
that
he
did
take
upon
himself
the
next
morning
to
ask
her
why
she
had
walked
out
so
late
only
in
search
of
events
grandfather
she
said
looking
out
of
the
window
with
that
drowsy
latency
of
manner
which
discovered
so
much
force
behind
it
whenever
the
trigger
was
pressed
search
of
events
one
would
think
you
were
one
of
the
bucks
i
knew
at
one
and
twenty
it
is
lonely
here
so
much
the
better
if
i
were
living
in
a
town
my
whole
time
would
be
taken
up
in
looking
after
you
i
fully
expected
you
would
have
been
home
when
i
returned
from
the
woman
i
won
t
conceal
what
i
did
i
wanted
an
adventure
and
i
went
with
the
mummers
i
played
the
part
of
the
turkish
knight
no
never
ha
ha
good
gad
i
didn
t
expect
it
of
you
eustacia
it
was
my
first
performance
and
it
certainly
will
be
my
last
now
i
have
told
you
and
remember
it
is
a
secret
of
course
but
eustacia
you
never
did
ha
ha
dammy
how
twould
have
pleased
me
forty
years
ago
but
remember
no
more
of
it
my
girl
you
may
walk
on
the
heath
night
or
day
as
you
choose
so
that
you
don
t
bother
me
but
no
figuring
in
breeches
again
you
need
have
no
fear
for
me
grandpapa
here
the
conversation
ceased
eustacia
s
moral
training
never
exceeding
in
severity
a
dialogue
of
this
sort
which
if
it
ever
became
profitable
to
good
works
would
be
a
result
not
dear
at
the
price
but
her
thoughts
soon
strayed
far
from
her
own
personality
and
full
of
a
passionate
and
indescribable
solicitude
for
one
to
whom
she
was
not
even
a
name
she
went
forth
into
the
amplitude
of
tanned
wild
around
her
restless
as
ahasuerus
the
jew
she
was
about
half
a
mile
from
her
residence
when
she
beheld
a
sinister
redness
arising
from
a
ravine
a
little
way
in
advance
dull
and
lurid
like
a
flame
in
sunlight
and
she
guessed
it
to
signify
diggory
venn
when
the
farmers
who
had
wished
to
buy
in
a
new
stock
of
reddle
during
the
last
month
had
inquired
where
venn
was
to
be
found
people
replied
on
egdon
heath
day
after
day
the
answer
was
the
same
now
since
egdon
was
populated
with
heath
croppers
and
furze
cutters
rather
than
with
sheep
and
shepherds
and
the
downs
where
most
of
the
latter
were
to
be
found
lay
some
to
the
north
some
to
the
west
of
egdon
his
reason
for
camping
about
there
like
israel
in
zin
was
not
apparent
the
position
was
central
and
occasionally
desirable
but
the
sale
of
reddle
was
not
diggory
s
primary
object
in
remaining
on
the
heath
particularly
at
so
late
a
period
of
the
year
when
most
travellers
of
his
class
had
gone
into
winter
quarters
eustacia
looked
at
the
lonely
man
wildeve
had
told
her
at
their
last
meeting
that
venn
had
been
thrust
forward
by
mrs
yeobright
as
one
ready
and
anxious
to
take
his
place
as
thomasin
s
betrothed
his
figure
was
perfect
his
face
young
and
well
outlined
his
eye
bright
his
intelligence
keen
and
his
position
one
which
he
could
readily
better
if
he
chose
but
in
spite
of
possibilities
it
was
not
likely
that
thomasin
would
accept
this
ishmaelitish
creature
while
she
had
a
cousin
like
yeobright
at
her
elbow
and
wildeve
at
the
same
time
not
absolutely
indifferent
eustacia
was
not
long
in
guessing
that
poor
mrs
yeobright
in
her
anxiety
for
her
niece
s
future
had
mentioned
this
lover
to
stimulate
the
zeal
of
the
other
eustacia
was
on
the
side
of
the
yeobrights
now
and
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
aunt
s
desire
good
morning
miss
said
the
reddleman
taking
off
his
cap
of
hareskin
and
apparently
bearing
her
no
ill
will
from
recollection
of
their
last
meeting
good
morning
reddleman
she
said
hardly
troubling
to
lift
her
heavily
shaded
eyes
to
his
i
did
not
know
you
were
so
near
is
your
van
here
too
venn
moved
his
elbow
towards
a
hollow
in
which
a
dense
brake
of
purple
stemmed
brambles
had
grown
to
such
vast
dimensions
as
almost
to
form
a
dell
brambles
though
churlish
when
handled
are
kindly
shelter
in
early
winter
being
the
latest
of
the
deciduous
bushes
to
lose
their
leaves
the
roof
and
chimney
of
venn
s
caravan
showed
behind
the
tracery
and
tangles
of
the
brake
you
remain
near
this
part
she
asked
with
more
interest
yes
i
have
business
here
not
altogether
the
selling
of
reddle
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
it
has
to
do
with
miss
yeobright
her
face
seemed
to
ask
for
an
armed
peace
and
he
therefore
said
frankly
yes
miss
it
is
on
account
of
her
on
account
of
your
approaching
marriage
with
her
venn
flushed
through
his
stain
don
t
make
sport
of
me
miss
vye
he
said
it
isn
t
true
certainly
not
she
was
thus
convinced
that
the
reddleman
was
a
mere
pis
aller
in
mrs
yeobright
s
mind
one
moreover
who
had
not
even
been
informed
of
his
promotion
to
that
lowly
standing
it
was
a
mere
notion
of
mine
she
said
quietly
and
was
about
to
pass
by
without
further
speech
when
looking
round
to
the
right
she
saw
a
painfully
well
known
figure
serpentining
upwards
by
one
of
the
little
paths
which
led
to
the
top
where
she
stood
owing
to
the
necessary
windings
of
his
course
his
back
was
at
present
towards
them
she
glanced
quickly
round
to
escape
that
man
there
was
only
one
way
turning
to
venn
she
said
would
you
allow
me
to
rest
a
few
minutes
in
your
van
the
banks
are
damp
for
sitting
on
certainly
miss
i
ll
make
a
place
for
you
she
followed
him
behind
the
dell
of
brambles
to
his
wheeled
dwelling
into
which
venn
mounted
placing
the
three
legged
stool
just
within
the
door
that
is
the
best
i
can
do
for
you
he
said
stepping
down
and
retiring
to
the
path
where
he
resumed
the
smoking
of
his
pipe
as
he
walked
up
and
down
eustacia
bounded
into
the
vehicle
and
sat
on
the
stool
ensconced
from
view
on
the
side
towards
the
trackway
soon
she
heard
the
brushing
of
other
feet
than
the
reddleman
s
a
not
very
friendly
good
day
uttered
by
two
men
in
passing
each
other
and
then
the
dwindling
of
the
foot
fall
of
one
of
them
in
a
direction
onwards
eustacia
stretched
her
neck
forward
till
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
receding
back
and
shoulders
and
she
felt
a
wretched
twinge
of
misery
she
knew
not
why
it
was
the
sickening
feeling
which
if
the
changed
heart
has
any
generosity
at
all
in
its
composition
accompanies
the
sudden
sight
of
a
once
loved
one
who
is
beloved
no
more
when
eustacia
descended
to
proceed
on
her
way
the
reddleman
came
near
that
was
mr
wildeve
who
passed
miss
he
said
slowly
and
expressed
by
his
face
that
he
expected
her
to
feel
vexed
at
having
been
sitting
unseen
yes
i
saw
him
coming
up
the
hill
replied
eustacia
why
should
you
tell
me
that
it
was
a
bold
question
considering
the
reddleman
s
knowledge
of
her
past
love
but
her
undemonstrative
manner
had
power
to
repress
the
opinions
of
those
she
treated
as
remote
from
her
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
you
can
ask
it
said
the
reddleman
bluntly
and
now
i
think
of
it
it
agrees
with
what
i
saw
last
night
ah
what
was
that
eustacia
wished
to
leave
him
but
wished
to
know
mr
wildeve
stayed
at
rainbarrow
a
long
time
waiting
for
a
lady
who
didn
t
come
you
waited
too
it
seems
yes
i
always
do
i
was
glad
to
see
him
disappointed
he
will
be
there
again
tonight
to
be
again
disappointed
the
truth
is
reddleman
that
that
lady
so
far
from
wishing
to
stand
in
the
way
of
thomasin
s
marriage
with
mr
wildeve
would
be
very
glad
to
promote
it
venn
felt
much
astonishment
at
this
avowal
though
he
did
not
show
it
clearly
that
exhibition
may
greet
remarks
which
are
one
remove
from
expectation
but
it
is
usually
withheld
in
complicated
cases
of
two
removes
and
upwards
indeed
miss
he
replied
how
do
you
know
that
mr
wildeve
will
come
to
rainbarrow
again
tonight
she
asked
i
heard
him
say
to
himself
that
he
would
he
s
in
a
regular
temper
eustacia
looked
for
a
moment
what
she
felt
and
she
murmured
lifting
her
deep
dark
eyes
anxiously
to
his
i
wish
i
knew
what
to
do
i
don
t
want
to
be
uncivil
to
him
but
i
don
t
wish
to
see
him
again
and
i
have
some
few
little
things
to
return
to
him
if
you
choose
to
send
em
by
me
miss
and
a
note
to
tell
him
that
you
wish
to
say
no
more
to
him
i
ll
take
it
for
you
quite
privately
that
would
be
the
most
straightforward
way
of
letting
him
know
your
mind
very
well
said
eustacia
come
towards
my
house
and
i
will
bring
it
out
to
you
she
went
on
and
as
the
path
was
an
infinitely
small
parting
in
the
shaggy
locks
of
the
heath
the
reddleman
followed
exactly
in
her
trail
she
saw
from
a
distance
that
the
captain
was
on
the
bank
sweeping
the
horizon
with
his
telescope
and
bidding
venn
to
wait
where
he
stood
she
entered
the
house
alone
in
ten
minutes
she
returned
with
a
parcel
and
a
note
and
said
in
placing
them
in
his
hand
why
are
you
so
ready
to
take
these
for
me
can
you
ask
that
i
suppose
you
think
to
serve
thomasin
in
some
way
by
it
are
you
as
anxious
as
ever
to
help
on
her
marriage
venn
was
a
little
moved
i
would
sooner
have
married
her
myself
he
said
in
a
low
voice
but
what
i
feel
is
that
if
she
cannot
be
happy
without
him
i
will
do
my
duty
in
helping
her
to
get
him
as
a
man
ought
eustacia
looked
curiously
at
the
singular
man
who
spoke
thus
what
a
strange
sort
of
love
to
be
entirely
free
from
that
quality
of
selfishness
which
is
frequently
the
chief
constituent
of
the
passion
and
sometimes
its
only
one
the
reddleman
s
disinterestedness
was
so
well
deserving
of
respect
that
it
overshot
respect
by
being
barely
comprehended
and
she
almost
thought
it
absurd
then
we
are
both
of
one
mind
at
last
she
said
yes
replied
venn
gloomily
but
if
you
would
tell
me
miss
why
you
take
such
an
interest
in
her
i
should
be
easier
it
is
so
sudden
and
strange
eustacia
appeared
at
a
loss
i
cannot
tell
you
that
reddleman
she
said
coldly
venn
said
no
more
he
pocketed
the
letter
and
bowing
to
eustacia
went
away
rainbarrow
had
again
become
blended
with
night
when
wildeve
ascended
the
long
acclivity
at
its
base
on
his
reaching
the
top
a
shape
grew
up
from
the
earth
immediately
behind
him
it
was
that
of
eustacia
s
emissary
he
slapped
wildeve
on
the
shoulder
the
feverish
young
inn
keeper
and
ex
engineer
started
like
satan
at
the
touch
of
ithuriel
s
spear
the
meeting
is
always
at
eight
o
clock
at
this
place
said
venn
and
here
we
are
we
three
we
three
said
wildeve
looking
quickly
round
yes
you
and
i
and
she
this
is
she
he
held
up
the
letter
and
parcel
wildeve
took
them
wonderingly
i
don
t
quite
see
what
this
means
he
said
how
do
you
come
here
there
must
be
some
mistake
it
will
be
cleared
from
your
mind
when
you
have
read
the
letter
lanterns
for
one
the
reddleman
struck
a
light
kindled
an
inch
of
tallow
candle
which
he
had
brought
and
sheltered
it
with
his
cap
who
are
you
said
wildeve
discerning
by
the
candle
light
an
obscure
rubicundity
of
person
in
his
companion
you
are
the
reddleman
i
saw
on
the
hill
this
morning
why
you
are
the
man
who
please
read
the
letter
if
you
had
come
from
the
other
one
i
shouldn
t
have
been
surprised
murmured
wildeve
as
he
opened
the
letter
and
read
his
face
grew
serious
to
mr
wildeve
after
some
thought
i
have
decided
once
and
for
all
that
we
must
hold
no
further
communication
the
more
i
consider
the
matter
the
more
i
am
convinced
that
there
must
be
an
end
to
our
acquaintance
had
you
been
uniformly
faithful
to
me
throughout
these
two
years
you
might
now
have
some
ground
for
accusing
me
of
heartlessness
but
if
you
calmly
consider
what
i
bore
during
the
period
of
your
desertion
and
how
i
passively
put
up
with
your
courtship
of
another
without
once
interfering
you
will
i
think
own
that
i
have
a
right
to
consult
my
own
feelings
when
you
come
back
to
me
again
that
these
are
not
what
they
were
towards
you
may
perhaps
be
a
fault
in
me
but
it
is
one
which
you
can
scarcely
reproach
me
for
when
you
remember
how
you
left
me
for
thomasin
the
little
articles
you
gave
me
in
the
early
part
of
our
friendship
are
returned
by
the
bearer
of
this
letter
they
should
rightly
have
been
sent
back
when
i
first
heard
of
your
engagement
to
her
eustacia
by
the
time
that
wildeve
reached
her
name
the
blankness
with
which
he
had
read
the
first
half
of
the
letter
intensified
to
mortification
i
am
made
a
great
fool
of
one
way
and
another
he
said
pettishly
do
you
know
what
is
in
this
letter
the
reddleman
hummed
a
tune
can
t
you
answer
me
asked
wildeve
warmly
ru
um
tum
tum
sang
the
reddleman
wildeve
stood
looking
on
the
ground
beside
venn
s
feet
till
he
allowed
his
eyes
to
travel
upwards
over
diggory
s
form
as
illuminated
by
the
candle
to
his
head
and
face
ha
ha
well
i
suppose
i
deserve
it
considering
how
i
have
played
with
them
both
he
said
at
last
as
much
to
himself
as
to
venn
but
of
all
the
odd
things
that
ever
i
knew
the
oddest
is
that
you
should
so
run
counter
to
your
own
interests
as
to
bring
this
to
me
my
interests
certainly
twas
your
interest
not
to
do
anything
which
would
send
me
courting
thomasin
again
now
she
has
accepted
you
or
something
like
it
mrs
yeobright
says
you
are
to
marry
her
tisn
t
true
then
good
lord
i
heard
of
this
before
but
didn
t
believe
it
when
did
she
say
so
wildeve
began
humming
as
the
reddleman
had
done
i
don
t
believe
it
now
cried
venn
ru
um
tum
tum
sang
wildeve
o
lord
how
we
can
imitate
said
venn
contemptuously
i
ll
have
this
out
i
ll
go
straight
to
her
diggory
withdrew
with
an
emphatic
step
wildeve
s
eye
passing
over
his
form
in
withering
derision
as
if
he
were
no
more
than
a
heath
cropper
when
the
reddleman
s
figure
could
no
longer
be
seen
wildeve
himself
descended
and
plunged
into
the
rayless
hollow
of
the
vale
to
lose
the
two
women
he
who
had
been
the
well
beloved
of
both
was
too
ironical
an
issue
to
be
endured
he
could
only
decently
save
himself
by
thomasin
and
once
he
became
her
husband
eustacia
s
repentance
he
thought
would
set
in
for
a
long
and
bitter
term
it
was
no
wonder
that
wildeve
ignorant
of
the
new
man
at
the
back
of
the
scene
should
have
supposed
eustacia
to
be
playing
a
part
to
believe
that
the
letter
was
not
the
result
of
some
momentary
pique
to
infer
that
she
really
gave
him
up
to
thomasin
would
have
required
previous
knowledge
of
her
transfiguration
by
that
man
s
influence
who
was
to
know
that
she
had
grown
generous
in
the
greediness
of
a
new
passion
that
in
coveting
one
cousin
she
was
dealing
liberally
with
another
that
in
her
eagerness
to
appropriate
she
gave
way
full
of
this
resolve
to
marry
in
haste
and
wring
the
heart
of
the
proud
girl
wildeve
went
his
way
meanwhile
diggory
venn
had
returned
to
his
van
where
he
stood
looking
thoughtfully
into
the
stove
a
new
vista
was
opened
up
to
him
but
however
promising
mrs
yeobright
s
views
of
him
might
be
as
a
candidate
for
her
niece
s
hand
one
condition
was
indispensable
to
the
favour
of
thomasin
herself
and
that
was
a
renunciation
of
his
present
wild
mode
of
life
in
this
he
saw
little
difficulty
he
could
not
afford
to
wait
till
the
next
day
before
seeing
thomasin
and
detailing
his
plan
he
speedily
plunged
himself
into
toilet
operations
pulled
a
suit
of
cloth
clothes
from
a
box
and
in
about
twenty
minutes
stood
before
the
van
lantern
as
a
reddleman
in
nothing
but
his
face
the
vermilion
shades
of
which
were
not
to
be
removed
in
a
day
closing
the
door
and
fastening
it
with
a
padlock
venn
set
off
towards
blooms
end
he
had
reached
the
white
palings
and
laid
his
hand
upon
the
gate
when
the
door
of
the
house
opened
and
quickly
closed
again
a
female
form
had
glided
in
at
the
same
time
a
man
who
had
seemingly
been
standing
with
the
woman
in
the
porch
came
forward
from
the
house
till
he
was
face
to
face
with
venn
it
was
wildeve
again
man
alive
you
ve
been
quick
at
it
said
diggory
sarcastically
and
you
slow
as
you
will
find
said
wildeve
and
lowering
his
voice
you
may
as
well
go
back
again
now
i
ve
claimed
her
and
got
her
good
night
reddleman
thereupon
wildeve
walked
away
venn
s
heart
sank
within
him
though
it
had
not
risen
unduly
high
he
stood
leaning
over
the
palings
in
an
indecisive
mood
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
he
went
up
the
garden
path
knocked
and
asked
for
mrs
yeobright
instead
of
requesting
him
to
enter
she
came
to
the
porch
a
discourse
was
carried
on
between
them
in
low
measured
tones
for
the
space
of
ten
minutes
or
more
at
the
end
of
the
time
mrs
yeobright
went
in
and
venn
sadly
retraced
his
steps
into
the
heath
when
he
had
again
regained
his
van
he
lit
the
lantern
and
with
an
apathetic
face
at
once
began
to
pull
off
his
best
clothes
till
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
he
reappeared
as
the
confirmed
and
irretrievable
reddleman
that
he
had
seemed
before
firmness
is
discovered
in
a
gentle
heart
on
that
evening
the
interior
of
blooms
end
though
cosy
and
comfortable
had
been
rather
silent
clym
yeobright
was
not
at
home
since
the
christmas
party
he
had
gone
on
a
few
days
visit
to
a
friend
about
ten
miles
off
the
shadowy
form
seen
by
venn
to
part
from
wildeve
in
the
porch
and
quickly
withdraw
into
the
house
was
thomasin
s
on
entering
she
threw
down
a
cloak
which
had
been
carelessly
wrapped
round
her
and
came
forward
to
the
light
where
mrs
yeobright
sat
at
her
work
table
drawn
up
within
the
settle
so
that
part
of
it
projected
into
the
chimney
corner
i
don
t
like
your
going
out
after
dark
alone
tamsin
said
her
aunt
quietly
without
looking
up
from
her
work
i
have
only
been
just
outside
the
door
well
inquired
mrs
yeobright
struck
by
a
change
in
the
tone
of
thomasin
s
voice
and
observing
her
thomasin
s
cheek
was
flushed
to
a
pitch
far
beyond
that
which
it
had
reached
before
her
troubles
and
her
eyes
glittered
it
was
he
who
knocked
she
said
i
thought
as
much
he
wishes
the
marriage
to
be
at
once
indeed
what
is
he
anxious
mrs
yeobright
directed
a
searching
look
upon
her
niece
why
did
not
mr
wildeve
come
in
he
did
not
wish
to
you
are
not
friends
with
him
he
says
he
would
like
the
wedding
to
be
the
day
after
tomorrow
quite
privately
at
the
church
of
his
parish
not
at
ours
oh
and
what
did
you
say
i
agreed
to
it
thomasin
answered
firmly
i
am
a
practical
woman
now
i
don
t
believe
in
hearts
at
all
i
would
marry
him
under
any
circumstances
since
since
clym
s
letter
a
letter
was
lying
on
mrs
yeobright
s
work
basket
and
at
thomasin
s
words
her
aunt
reopened
it
and
silently
read
for
the
tenth
time
that
day
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
silly
story
that
people
are
circulating
about
thomasin
and
mr
wildeve
i
should
call
such
a
scandal
humiliating
if
there
was
the
least
chance
of
its
being
true
how
could
such
a
gross
falsehood
have
arisen
it
is
said
that
one
should
go
abroad
to
hear
news
of
home
and
i
appear
to
have
done
it
of
course
i
contradict
the
tale
everywhere
but
it
is
very
vexing
and
i
wonder
how
it
could
have
originated
it
is
too
ridiculous
that
such
a
girl
as
thomasin
could
so
mortify
us
as
to
get
jilted
on
the
wedding
day
what
has
she
done
yes
mrs
yeobright
said
sadly
putting
down
the
letter
if
you
think
you
can
marry
him
do
so
and
since
mr
wildeve
wishes
it
to
be
unceremonious
let
it
be
that
too
i
can
do
nothing
it
is
all
in
your
own
hands
now
my
power
over
your
welfare
came
to
an
end
when
you
left
this
house
to
go
with
him
to
anglebury
she
continued
half
in
bitterness
i
may
almost
ask
why
do
you
consult
me
in
the
matter
at
all
if
you
had
gone
and
married
him
without
saying
a
word
to
me
i
could
hardly
have
been
angry
simply
because
poor
girl
you
can
t
do
a
better
thing
don
t
say
that
and
dishearten
me
you
are
right
i
will
not
i
do
not
plead
for
him
aunt
human
nature
is
weak
and
i
am
not
a
blind
woman
to
insist
that
he
is
perfect
i
did
think
so
but
i
don
t
now
but
i
know
my
course
and
you
know
that
i
know
it
i
hope
for
the
best
and
so
do
i
and
we
will
both
continue
to
said
mrs
yeobright
rising
and
kissing
her
then
the
wedding
if
it
comes
off
will
be
on
the
morning
of
the
very
day
clym
comes
home
yes
i
decided
that
it
ought
to
be
over
before
he
came
after
that
you
can
look
him
in
the
face
and
so
can
i
our
concealments
will
matter
nothing
mrs
yeobright
moved
her
head
in
thoughtful
assent
and
presently
said
do
you
wish
me
to
give
you
away
i
am
willing
to
undertake
that
you
know
if
you
wish
as
i
was
last
time
after
once
forbidding
the
banns
i
think
i
can
do
no
less
i
don
t
think
i
will
ask
you
to
come
said
thomasin
reluctantly
but
with
decision
it
would
be
unpleasant
i
am
almost
sure
better
let
there
be
only
strangers
present
and
none
of
my
relations
at
all
i
would
rather
have
it
so
i
do
not
wish
to
do
anything
which
may
touch
your
credit
and
i
feel
that
i
should
be
uncomfortable
if
you
were
there
after
what
has
passed
i
am
only
your
niece
and
there
is
no
necessity
why
you
should
concern
yourself
more
about
me
well
he
has
beaten
us
her
aunt
said
it
really
seems
as
if
he
had
been
playing
with
you
in
this
way
in
revenge
for
my
humbling
him
as
i
did
by
standing
up
against
him
at
first
o
no
aunt
murmured
thomasin
they
said
no
more
on
the
subject
then
diggory
venn
s
knock
came
soon
after
and
mrs
yeobright
on
returning
from
her
interview
with
him
in
the
porch
carelessly
observed
another
lover
has
come
to
ask
for
you
no
yes
that
queer
young
man
venn
asks
to
pay
his
addresses
to
me
yes
and
i
told
him
he
was
too
late
thomasin
looked
silently
into
the
candle
flame
poor
diggory
she
said
and
then
aroused
herself
to
other
things
the
next
day
was
passed
in
mere
mechanical
deeds
of
preparation
both
the
women
being
anxious
to
immerse
themselves
in
these
to
escape
the
emotional
aspect
of
the
situation
some
wearing
apparel
and
other
articles
were
collected
anew
for
thomasin
and
remarks
on
domestic
details
were
frequently
made
so
as
to
obscure
any
inner
misgivings
about
her
future
as
wildeve
s
wife
the
appointed
morning
came
the
arrangement
with
wildeve
was
that
he
should
meet
her
at
the
church
to
guard
against
any
unpleasant
curiosity
which
might
have
affected
them
had
they
been
seen
walking
off
together
in
the
usual
country
way
aunt
and
niece
stood
together
in
the
bedroom
where
the
bride
was
dressing
the
sun
where
it
could
catch
it
made
a
mirror
of
thomasin
s
hair
which
she
always
wore
braided
it
was
braided
according
to
a
calendar
system
the
more
important
the
day
the
more
numerous
the
strands
in
the
braid
on
ordinary
working
days
she
braided
it
in
threes
on
ordinary
sundays
in
fours
at
maypolings
gipsyings
and
the
like
she
braided
it
in
fives
years
ago
she
had
said
that
when
she
married
she
would
braid
it
in
sevens
she
had
braided
it
in
sevens
today
i
have
been
thinking
that
i
will
wear
my
blue
silk
after
all
she
said
it
is
my
wedding
day
even
though
there
may
be
something
sad
about
the
time
i
mean
she
added
anxious
to
correct
any
wrong
impression
not
sad
in
itself
but
in
its
having
had
great
disappointment
and
trouble
before
it
mrs
yeobright
breathed
in
a
way
which
might
have
been
called
a
sigh
i
almost
wish
clym
had
been
at
home
she
said
of
course
you
chose
the
time
because
of
his
absence
partly
i
have
felt
that
i
acted
unfairly
to
him
in
not
telling
him
all
but
as
it
was
done
not
to
grieve
him
i
thought
i
would
carry
out
the
plan
to
its
end
and
tell
the
whole
story
when
the
sky
was
clear
you
are
a
practical
little
woman
said
mrs
yeobright
smiling
i
wish
you
and
he
no
i
don
t
wish
anything
there
it
is
nine
o
clock
she
interrupted
hearing
a
whizz
and
a
dinging
downstairs
i
told
damon
i
would
leave
at
nine
said
thomasin
hastening
out
of
the
room
her
aunt
followed
when
thomasin
was
going
up
the
little
walk
from
the
door
to
the
wicket
gate
mrs
yeobright
looked
reluctantly
at
her
and
said
it
is
a
shame
to
let
you
go
alone
it
is
necessary
said
thomasin
at
any
rate
added
her
aunt
with
forced
cheerfulness
i
shall
call
upon
you
this
afternoon
and
bring
the
cake
with
me
if
clym
has
returned
by
that
time
he
will
perhaps
come
too
i
wish
to
show
mr
wildeve
that
i
bear
him
no
ill
will
let
the
past
be
forgotten
well
god
bless
you
there
i
don
t
believe
in
old
superstitions
but
i
ll
do
it
she
threw
a
slipper
at
the
retreating
figure
of
the
girl
who
turned
smiled
and
went
on
again
a
few
steps
further
and
she
looked
back
did
you
call
me
aunt
she
tremulously
inquired
good
bye
moved
by
an
uncontrollable
feeling
as
she
looked
upon
mrs
yeobright
s
worn
wet
face
she
ran
back
when
her
aunt
came
forward
and
they
met
again
o
tamsie
said
the
elder
weeping
i
don
t
like
to
let
you
go
i
i
am
thomasin
began
giving
way
likewise
but
quelling
her
grief
she
said
good
bye
again
and
went
on
then
mrs
yeobright
saw
a
little
figure
wending
its
way
between
the
scratching
furze
bushes
and
diminishing
far
up
the
valley
a
pale
blue
spot
in
a
vast
field
of
neutral
brown
solitary
and
undefended
except
by
the
power
of
her
own
hope
but
the
worst
feature
in
the
case
was
one
which
did
not
appear
in
the
landscape
it
was
the
man
the
hour
chosen
for
the
ceremony
by
thomasin
and
wildeve
had
been
so
timed
as
to
enable
her
to
escape
the
awkwardness
of
meeting
her
cousin
clym
who
was
returning
the
same
morning
to
own
to
the
partial
truth
of
what
he
had
heard
would
be
distressing
as
long
as
the
humiliating
position
resulting
from
the
event
was
unimproved
it
was
only
after
a
second
and
successful
journey
to
the
altar
that
she
could
lift
up
her
head
and
prove
the
failure
of
the
first
attempt
a
pure
accident
she
had
not
been
gone
from
blooms
end
more
than
half
an
hour
when
yeobright
came
by
the
meads
from
the
other
direction
and
entered
the
house
i
had
an
early
breakfast
he
said
to
his
mother
after
greeting
her
now
i
could
eat
a
little
more
they
sat
down
to
the
repeated
meal
and
he
went
on
in
a
low
anxious
voice
apparently
imagining
that
thomasin
had
not
yet
come
downstairs
what
s
this
i
have
heard
about
thomasin
and
mr
wildeve
it
is
true
in
many
points
said
mrs
yeobright
quietly
but
it
is
all
right
now
i
hope
she
looked
at
the
clock
true
thomasin
is
gone
to
him
today
clym
pushed
away
his
breakfast
then
there
is
a
scandal
of
some
sort
and
that
s
what
s
the
matter
with
thomasin
was
it
this
that
made
her
ill
yes
not
a
scandal
a
misfortune
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
clym
you
must
not
be
angry
but
you
must
listen
and
you
ll
find
that
what
we
have
done
has
been
done
for
the
best
she
then
told
him
the
circumstances
all
that
he
had
known
of
the
affair
before
he
returned
from
paris
was
that
there
had
existed
an
attachment
between
thomasin
and
wildeve
which
his
mother
had
at
first
discountenanced
but
had
since
owing
to
the
arguments
of
thomasin
looked
upon
in
a
little
more
favourable
light
when
she
therefore
proceeded
to
explain
all
he
was
greatly
surprised
and
troubled
and
she
determined
that
the
wedding
should
be
over
before
you
came
back
said
mrs
yeobright
that
there
might
be
no
chance
of
her
meeting
you
and
having
a
very
painful
time
of
it
that
s
why
she
has
gone
to
him
they
have
arranged
to
be
married
this
morning
but
i
can
t
understand
it
said
yeobright
rising
tis
so
unlike
her
i
can
see
why
you
did
not
write
to
me
after
her
unfortunate
return
home
but
why
didn
t
you
let
me
know
when
the
wedding
was
going
to
be
the
first
time
well
i
felt
vexed
with
her
just
then
she
seemed
to
me
to
be
obstinate
and
when
i
found
that
you
were
nothing
in
her
mind
i
vowed
that
she
should
be
nothing
in
yours
i
felt
that
she
was
only
my
niece
after
all
i
told
her
she
might
marry
but
that
i
should
take
no
interest
in
it
and
should
not
bother
you
about
it
either
it
wouldn
t
have
been
bothering
me
mother
you
did
wrong
i
thought
it
might
disturb
you
in
your
business
and
that
you
might
throw
up
your
situation
or
injure
your
prospects
in
some
way
because
of
it
so
i
said
nothing
of
course
if
they
had
married
at
that
time
in
a
proper
manner
i
should
have
told
you
at
once
tamsin
actually
being
married
while
we
are
sitting
here
yes
unless
some
accident
happens
again
as
it
did
the
first
time
it
may
considering
he
s
the
same
man
yes
and
i
believe
it
will
was
it
right
to
let
her
go
suppose
wildeve
is
really
a
bad
fellow
then
he
won
t
come
and
she
ll
come
home
again
you
should
have
looked
more
into
it
it
is
useless
to
say
that
his
mother
answered
with
an
impatient
look
of
sorrow
you
don
t
know
how
bad
it
has
been
here
with
us
all
these
weeks
clym
you
don
t
know
what
a
mortification
anything
of
that
sort
is
to
a
woman
you
don
t
know
the
sleepless
nights
we
ve
had
in
this
house
and
the
almost
bitter
words
that
have
passed
between
us
since
that
fifth
of
november
i
hope
never
to
pass
seven
such
weeks
again
tamsin
has
not
gone
outside
the
door
and
i
have
been
ashamed
to
look
anybody
in
the
face
and
now
you
blame
me
for
letting
her
do
the
only
thing
that
can
be
done
to
set
that
trouble
straight
no
he
said
slowly
upon
the
whole
i
don
t
blame
you
but
just
consider
how
sudden
it
seems
to
me
here
was
i
knowing
nothing
and
then
i
am
told
all
at
once
that
tamsie
is
gone
to
be
married
well
i
suppose
there
was
nothing
better
to
do
do
you
know
mother
he
continued
after
a
moment
or
two
looking
suddenly
interested
in
his
own
past
history
i
once
thought
of
tamsin
as
a
sweetheart
yes
i
did
how
odd
boys
are
and
when
i
came
home
and
saw
her
this
time
she
seemed
so
much
more
affectionate
than
usual
that
i
was
quite
reminded
of
those
days
particularly
on
the
night
of
the
party
when
she
was
unwell
we
had
the
party
just
the
same
was
not
that
rather
cruel
to
her
it
made
no
difference
i
had
arranged
to
give
one
and
it
was
not
worth
while
to
make
more
gloom
than
necessary
to
begin
by
shutting
ourselves
up
and
telling
you
of
tamsin
s
misfortunes
would
have
been
a
poor
sort
of
welcome
clym
remained
thinking
i
almost
wish
you
had
not
had
that
party
he
said
and
for
other
reasons
but
i
will
tell
you
in
a
day
or
two
we
must
think
of
tamsin
now
they
lapsed
into
silence
i
ll
tell
you
what
said
yeobright
again
in
a
tone
which
showed
some
slumbering
feeling
still
i
don
t
think
it
kind
to
tamsin
to
let
her
be
married
like
this
and
neither
of
us
there
to
keep
up
her
spirits
or
care
a
bit
about
her
she
hasn
t
disgraced
herself
or
done
anything
to
deserve
that
it
is
bad
enough
that
the
wedding
should
be
so
hurried
and
unceremonious
without
our
keeping
away
from
it
in
addition
upon
my
soul
tis
almost
a
shame
i
ll
go
it
is
over
by
this
time
said
his
mother
with
a
sigh
unless
they
were
late
or
he
then
i
shall
be
soon
enough
to
see
them
come
out
i
don
t
quite
like
your
keeping
me
in
ignorance
mother
after
all
really
i
half
hope
he
has
failed
to
meet
her
and
ruined
her
character
nonsense
that
wouldn
t
ruin
thomasin
he
took
up
his
hat
and
hastily
left
the
house
mrs
yeobright
looked
rather
unhappy
and
sat
still
deep
in
thought
but
she
was
not
long
left
alone
a
few
minutes
later
clym
came
back
again
and
in
his
company
came
diggory
venn
i
find
there
isn
t
time
for
me
to
get
there
said
clym
is
she
married
mrs
yeobright
inquired
turning
to
the
reddleman
a
face
in
which
a
strange
strife
of
wishes
for
and
against
was
apparent
venn
bowed
she
is
ma
am
how
strange
it
sounds
murmured
clym
and
he
didn
t
disappoint
her
this
time
said
mrs
yeobright
he
did
not
and
there
is
now
no
slight
on
her
name
i
was
hastening
ath
art
to
tell
you
at
once
as
i
saw
you
were
not
there
how
came
you
to
be
there
how
did
you
know
it
she
asked
i
have
been
in
that
neighbourhood
for
some
time
and
i
saw
them
go
in
said
the
reddleman
wildeve
came
up
to
the
door
punctual
as
the
clock
i
didn
t
expect
it
of
him
he
did
not
add
as
he
might
have
added
that
how
he
came
to
be
in
that
neighbourhood
was
not
by
accident
that
since
wildeve
s
resumption
of
his
right
to
thomasin
venn
with
the
thoroughness
which
was
part
of
his
character
had
determined
to
see
the
end
of
the
episode
who
was
there
said
mrs
yeobright
nobody
hardly
i
stood
right
out
of
the
way
and
she
did
not
see
me
the
reddleman
spoke
huskily
and
looked
into
the
garden
who
gave
her
away
miss
vye
how
very
remarkable
miss
vye
it
is
to
be
considered
an
honour
i
suppose
who
s
miss
vye
said
clym
captain
vye
s
granddaughter
of
mistover
knap
a
proud
girl
from
budmouth
said
mrs
yeobright
one
not
much
to
my
liking
people
say
she
s
a
witch
but
of
course
that
s
absurd
the
reddleman
kept
to
himself
his
acquaintance
with
that
fair
personage
and
also
that
eustacia
was
there
because
he
went
to
fetch
her
in
accordance
with
a
promise
he
had
given
as
soon
as
he
learnt
that
the
marriage
was
to
take
place
he
merely
said
in
continuation
of
the
story
i
was
sitting
on
the
churchyard
wall
when
they
came
up
one
from
one
way
the
other
from
the
other
and
miss
vye
was
walking
thereabouts
looking
at
the
headstones
as
soon
as
they
had
gone
in
i
went
to
the
door
feeling
i
should
like
to
see
it
as
i
knew
her
so
well
i
pulled
off
my
boots
because
they
were
so
noisy
and
went
up
into
the
gallery
i
saw
then
that
the
parson
and
clerk
were
already
there
how
came
miss
vye
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
if
she
was
only
on
a
walk
that
way
because
there
was
nobody
else
she
had
gone
into
the
church
just
before
me
not
into
the
gallery
the
parson
looked
round
before
beginning
and
as
she
was
the
only
one
near
he
beckoned
to
her
and
she
went
up
to
the
rails
after
that
when
it
came
to
signing
the
book
she
pushed
up
her
veil
and
signed
and
tamsin
seemed
to
thank
her
for
her
kindness
the
reddleman
told
the
tale
thoughtfully
for
there
lingered
upon
his
vision
the
changing
colour
of
wildeve
when
eustacia
lifted
the
thick
veil
which
had
concealed
her
from
recognition
and
looked
calmly
into
his
face
and
then
said
diggory
sadly
i
came
away
for
her
history
as
tamsin
yeobright
was
over
i
offered
to
go
said
mrs
yeobright
regretfully
but
she
said
it
was
not
necessary
well
it
is
no
matter
said
the
reddleman
the
thing
is
done
at
last
as
it
was
meant
to
be
at
first
and
god
send
her
happiness
now
i
ll
wish
you
good
morning
he
placed
his
cap
on
his
head
and
went
out
from
that
instant
of
leaving
mrs
yeobright
s
door
the
reddleman
was
seen
no
more
in
or
about
egdon
heath
for
a
space
of
many
months
he
vanished
entirely
the
nook
among
the
brambles
where
his
van
had
been
standing
was
as
vacant
as
ever
the
next
morning
and
scarcely
a
sign
remained
to
show
that
he
had
been
there
excepting
a
few
straws
and
a
little
redness
on
the
turf
which
was
washed
away
by
the
next
storm
of
rain
the
report
that
diggory
had
brought
of
the
wedding
correct
as
far
as
it
went
was
deficient
in
one
significant
particular
which
had
escaped
him
through
his
being
at
some
distance
back
in
the
church
when
thomasin
was
tremblingly
engaged
in
signing
her
name
wildeve
had
flung
towards
eustacia
a
glance
that
said
plainly
i
have
punished
you
now
she
had
replied
in
a
low
tone
and
he
little
thought
how
truly
you
mistake
it
gives
me
sincerest
pleasure
to
see
her
your
wife
today
book
three
the
fascination
my
mind
to
me
a
kingdom
is
in
clym
yeobright
s
face
could
be
dimly
seen
the
typical
countenance
of
the
future
should
there
be
a
classic
period
to
art
hereafter
its
pheidias
may
produce
such
faces
the
view
of
life
as
a
thing
to
be
put
up
with
replacing
that
zest
for
existence
which
was
so
intense
in
early
civilizations
must
ultimately
enter
so
thoroughly
into
the
constitution
of
the
advanced
races
that
its
facial
expression
will
become
accepted
as
a
new
artistic
departure
people
already
feel
that
a
man
who
lives
without
disturbing
a
curve
of
feature
or
setting
a
mark
of
mental
concern
anywhere
upon
himself
is
too
far
removed
from
modern
perceptiveness
to
be
a
modern
type
physically
beautiful
men
the
glory
of
the
race
when
it
was
young
are
almost
an
anachronism
now
and
we
may
wonder
whether
at
some
time
or
other
physically
beautiful
women
may
not
be
an
anachronism
likewise
the
truth
seems
to
be
that
a
long
line
of
disillusive
centuries
has
permanently
displaced
the
hellenic
idea
of
life
or
whatever
it
may
be
called
what
the
greeks
only
suspected
we
know
well
what
their
aeschylus
imagined
our
nursery
children
feel
that
old
fashioned
revelling
in
the
general
situation
grows
less
and
less
possible
as
we
uncover
the
defects
of
natural
laws
and
see
the
quandary
that
man
is
in
by
their
operation
the
lineaments
which
will
get
embodied
in
ideals
based
upon
this
new
recognition
will
probably
be
akin
to
those
of
yeobright
the
observer
s
eye
was
arrested
not
by
his
face
as
a
picture
but
by
his
face
as
a
page
not
by
what
it
was
but
by
what
it
recorded
his
features
were
attractive
in
the
light
of
symbols
as
sounds
intrinsically
common
become
attractive
in
language
and
as
shapes
intrinsically
simple
become
interesting
in
writing
he
had
been
a
lad
of
whom
something
was
expected
beyond
this
all
had
been
chaos
that
he
would
be
successful
in
an
original
way
or
that
he
would
go
to
the
dogs
in
an
original
way
seemed
equally
probable
the
only
absolute
certainty
about
him
was
that
he
would
not
stand
still
in
the
circumstances
amid
which
he
was
born
hence
when
his
name
was
casually
mentioned
by
neighbouring
yeomen
the
listener
said
ah
clym
yeobright
what
is
he
doing
now
when
the
instinctive
question
about
a
person
is
what
is
he
doing
it
is
felt
that
he
will
be
found
to
be
like
most
of
us
doing
nothing
in
particular
there
is
an
indefinite
sense
that
he
must
be
invading
some
region
of
singularity
good
or
bad
the
devout
hope
is
that
he
is
doing
well
the
secret
faith
is
that
he
is
making
a
mess
of
it
half
a
dozen
comfortable
market
men
who
were
habitual
callers
at
the
quiet
woman
as
they
passed
by
in
their
carts
were
partial
to
the
topic
in
fact
though
they
were
not
egdon
men
they
could
hardly
avoid
it
while
they
sucked
their
long
clay
tubes
and
regarded
the
heath
through
the
window
clym
had
been
so
inwoven
with
the
heath
in
his
boyhood
that
hardly
anybody
could
look
upon
it
without
thinking
of
him
so
the
subject
recurred
if
he
were
making
a
fortune
and
a
name
so
much
the
better
for
him
if
he
were
making
a
tragical
figure
in
the
world
so
much
the
better
for
a
narrative
the
fact
was
that
yeobright
s
fame
had
spread
to
an
awkward
extent
before
he
left
home
it
is
bad
when
your
fame
outruns
your
means
said
the
spanish
jesuit
gracian
at
the
age
of
six
he
had
asked
a
scripture
riddle
who
was
the
first
man
known
to
wear
breeches
and
applause
had
resounded
from
the
very
verge
of
the
heath
at
seven
he
painted
the
battle
of
waterloo
with
tiger
lily
pollen
and
black
currant
juice
in
the
absence
of
water
colours
by
the
time
he
reached
twelve
he
had
in
this
manner
been
heard
of
as
artist
and
scholar
for
at
least
two
miles
round
an
individual
whose
fame
spreads
three
or
four
thousand
yards
in
the
time
taken
by
the
fame
of
others
similarly
situated
to
travel
six
or
eight
hundred
must
of
necessity
have
something
in
him
possibly
clym
s
fame
like
homer
s
owed
something
to
the
accidents
of
his
situation
nevertheless
famous
he
was
he
grew
up
and
was
helped
out
in
life
that
waggery
of
fate
which
started
clive
as
a
writing
clerk
gay
as
a
linen
draper
keats
as
a
surgeon
and
a
thousand
others
in
a
thousand
other
odd
ways
banished
the
wild
and
ascetic
heath
lad
to
a
trade
whose
sole
concern
was
with
the
especial
symbols
of
self
indulgence
and
vainglory
the
details
of
this
choice
of
a
business
for
him
it
is
not
necessary
to
give
at
the
death
of
his
father
a
neighbouring
gentleman
had
kindly
undertaken
to
give
the
boy
a
start
and
this
assumed
the
form
of
sending
him
to
budmouth
yeobright
did
not
wish
to
go
there
but
it
was
the
only
feasible
opening
thence
he
went
to
london
and
thence
shortly
after
to
paris
where
he
had
remained
till
now
something
being
expected
of
him
he
had
not
been
at
home
many
days
before
a
great
curiosity
as
to
why
he
stayed
on
so
long
began
to
arise
in
the
heath
the
natural
term
of
a
holiday
had
passed
yet
he
still
remained
on
the
sunday
morning
following
the
week
of
thomasin
s
marriage
a
discussion
on
this
subject
was
in
progress
at
a
hair
cutting
before
fairway
s
house
here
the
local
barbering
was
always
done
at
this
hour
on
this
day
to
be
followed
by
the
great
sunday
wash
of
the
inhabitants
at
noon
which
in
its
turn
was
followed
by
the
great
sunday
dressing
an
hour
later
on
egdon
heath
sunday
proper
did
not
begin
till
dinner
time
and
even
then
it
was
a
somewhat
battered
specimen
of
the
day
these
sunday
morning
hair
cuttings
were
performed
by
fairway
the
victim
sitting
on
a
chopping
block
in
front
of
the
house
without
a
coat
and
the
neighbours
gossiping
around
idly
observing
the
locks
of
hair
as
they
rose
upon
the
wind
after
the
snip
and
flew
away
out
of
sight
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
heavens
summer
and
winter
the
scene
was
the
same
unless
the
wind
were
more
than
usually
blusterous
when
the
stool
was
shifted
a
few
feet
round
the
corner
to
complain
of
cold
in
sitting
out
of
doors
hatless
and
coatless
while
fairway
told
true
stories
between
the
cuts
of
the
scissors
would
have
been
to
pronounce
yourself
no
man
at
once
to
flinch
exclaim
or
move
a
muscle
of
the
face
at
the
small
stabs
under
the
ear
received
from
those
instruments
or
at
scarifications
of
the
neck
by
the
comb
would
have
been
thought
a
gross
breach
of
good
manners
considering
that
fairway
did
it
all
for
nothing
a
bleeding
about
the
poll
on
sunday
afternoons
was
amply
accounted
for
by
the
explanation
i
have
had
my
hair
cut
you
know
the
conversation
on
yeobright
had
been
started
by
a
distant
view
of
the
young
man
rambling
leisurely
across
the
heath
before
them
a
man
who
is
doing
well
elsewhere
wouldn
t
bide
here
two
or
three
weeks
for
nothing
said
fairway
he
s
got
some
project
in
s
head
depend
upon
that
well
a
can
t
keep
a
diment
shop
here
said
sam
i
don
t
see
why
he
should
have
had
them
two
heavy
boxes
home
if
he
had
not
been
going
to
bide
and
what
there
is
for
him
to
do
here
the
lord
in
heaven
knows
before
many
more
surmises
could
be
indulged
in
yeobright
had
come
near
and
seeing
the
hair
cutting
group
he
turned
aside
to
join
them
marching
up
and
looking
critically
at
their
faces
for
a
moment
he
said
without
introduction
now
folks
let
me
guess
what
you
have
been
talking
about
ay
sure
if
you
will
said
sam
about
me
now
it
is
a
thing
i
shouldn
t
have
dreamed
of
doing
otherwise
said
fairway
in
a
tone
of
integrity
but
since
you
have
named
it
master
yeobright
i
ll
own
that
we
was
talking
about
ee
we
were
wondering
what
could
keep
you
home
here
mollyhorning
about
when
you
have
made
such
a
world
wide
name
for
yourself
in
the
nick
nack
trade
now
that
s
the
truth
o
t
i
ll
tell
you
said
yeobright
with
unexpected
earnestness
i
am
not
sorry
to
have
the
opportunity
i
ve
come
home
because
all
things
considered
i
can
be
a
trifle
less
useless
here
than
anywhere
else
but
i
have
only
lately
found
this
out
when
i
first
got
away
from
home
i
thought
this
place
was
not
worth
troubling
about
i
thought
our
life
here
was
contemptible
to
oil
your
boots
instead
of
blacking
them
to
dust
your
coat
with
a
switch
instead
of
a
brush
was
there
ever
anything
more
ridiculous
i
said
so
tis
so
tis
no
no
you
are
wrong
it
isn
t
beg
your
pardon
we
thought
that
was
your
meaning
well
as
my
views
changed
my
course
became
very
depressing
i
found
that
i
was
trying
to
be
like
people
who
had
hardly
anything
in
common
with
myself
i
was
endeavouring
to
put
off
one
sort
of
life
for
another
sort
of
life
which
was
not
better
than
the
life
i
had
known
before
it
was
simply
different
true
a
sight
different
said
fairway
yes
paris
must
be
a
taking
place
said
humphrey
grand
shop
winders
trumpets
and
drums
and
here
be
we
out
of
doors
in
all
winds
and
weathers
but
you
mistake
me
pleaded
clym
all
this
was
very
depressing
but
not
so
depressing
as
something
i
next
perceived
that
my
business
was
the
idlest
vainest
most
effeminate
business
that
ever
a
man
could
be
put
to
that
decided
me
i
would
give
it
up
and
try
to
follow
some
rational
occupation
among
the
people
i
knew
best
and
to
whom
i
could
be
of
most
use
i
have
come
home
and
this
is
how
i
mean
to
carry
out
my
plan
i
shall
keep
a
school
as
near
to
egdon
as
possible
so
as
to
be
able
to
walk
over
here
and
have
a
night
school
in
my
mother
s
house
but
i
must
study
a
little
at
first
to
get
properly
qualified
now
neighbours
i
must
go
and
clym
resumed
his
walk
across
the
heath
he
ll
never
carry
it
out
in
the
world
said
fairway
in
a
few
weeks
he
ll
learn
to
see
things
otherwise
tis
good
hearted
of
the
young
man
said
another
but
for
my
part
i
think
he
had
better
mind
his
business
the
new
course
causes
disappointment
yeobright
loved
his
kind
he
had
a
conviction
that
the
want
of
most
men
was
knowledge
of
a
sort
which
brings
wisdom
rather
than
affluence
he
wished
to
raise
the
class
at
the
expense
of
individuals
rather
than
individuals
at
the
expense
of
the
class
what
was
more
he
was
ready
at
once
to
be
the
first
unit
sacrificed
in
passing
from
the
bucolic
to
the
intellectual
life
the
intermediate
stages
are
usually
two
at
least
frequently
many
more
and
one
of
those
stages
is
almost
sure
to
be
worldly
advanced
we
can
hardly
imagine
bucolic
placidity
quickening
to
intellectual
aims
without
imagining
social
aims
as
the
transitional
phase
yeobright
s
local
peculiarity
was
that
in
striving
at
high
thinking
he
still
cleaved
to
plain
living
nay
wild
and
meagre
living
in
many
respects
and
brotherliness
with
clowns
he
was
a
john
the
baptist
who
took
ennoblement
rather
than
repentance
for
his
text
mentally
he
was
in
a
provincial
future
that
is
he
was
in
many
points
abreast
with
the
central
town
thinkers
of
his
date
much
of
this
development
he
may
have
owed
to
his
studious
life
in
paris
where
he
had
become
acquainted
with
ethical
systems
popular
at
the
time
in
consequence
of
this
relatively
advanced
position
yeobright
might
have
been
called
unfortunate
the
rural
world
was
not
ripe
for
him
a
man
should
be
only
partially
before
his
time
to
be
completely
to
the
vanward
in
aspirations
is
fatal
to
fame
had
philip
s
warlike
son
been
intellectually
so
far
ahead
as
to
have
attempted
civilization
without
bloodshed
he
would
have
been
twice
the
godlike
hero
that
he
seemed
but
nobody
would
have
heard
of
an
alexander
in
the
interests
of
renown
the
forwardness
should
lie
chiefly
in
the
capacity
to
handle
things
successful
propagandists
have
succeeded
because
the
doctrine
they
bring
into
form
is
that
which
their
listeners
have
for
some
time
felt
without
being
able
to
shape
a
man
who
advocates
aesthetic
effort
and
deprecates
social
effort
is
only
likely
to
be
understood
by
a
class
to
which
social
effort
has
become
a
stale
matter
to
argue
upon
the
possibility
of
culture
before
luxury
to
the
bucolic
world
may
be
to
argue
truly
but
it
is
an
attempt
to
disturb
a
sequence
to
which
humanity
has
been
long
accustomed
yeobright
preaching
to
the
egdon
eremites
that
they
might
rise
to
a
serene
comprehensiveness
without
going
through
the
process
of
enriching
themselves
was
not
unlike
arguing
to
ancient
chaldeans
that
in
ascending
from
earth
to
the
pure
empyrean
it
was
not
necessary
to
pass
first
into
the
intervening
heaven
of
ether
was
yeobright
s
mind
well
proportioned
no
a
well
proportioned
mind
is
one
which
shows
no
particular
bias
one
of
which
we
may
safely
say
that
it
will
never
cause
its
owner
to
be
confined
as
a
madman
tortured
as
a
heretic
or
crucified
as
a
blasphemer
also
on
the
other
hand
that
it
will
never
cause
him
to
be
applauded
as
a
prophet
revered
as
a
priest
or
exalted
as
a
king
its
usual
blessings
are
happiness
and
mediocrity
it
produces
the
poetry
of
rogers
the
paintings
of
west
the
statecraft
of
north
the
spiritual
guidance
of
tomline
enabling
its
possessors
to
find
their
way
to
wealth
to
wind
up
well
to
step
with
dignity
off
the
stage
to
die
comfortably
in
their
beds
and
to
get
the
decent
monument
which
in
many
cases
they
deserve
it
never
would
have
allowed
yeobright
to
do
such
a
ridiculous
thing
as
throw
up
his
business
to
benefit
his
fellow
creatures
he
walked
along
towards
home
without
attending
to
paths
if
anyone
knew
the
heath
well
it
was
clym
he
was
permeated
with
its
scenes
with
its
substance
and
with
its
odours
he
might
be
said
to
be
its
product
his
eyes
had
first
opened
thereon
with
its
appearance
all
the
first
images
of
his
memory
were
mingled
his
estimate
of
life
had
been
coloured
by
it
his
toys
had
been
the
flint
knives
and
arrow
heads
which
he
found
there
wondering
why
stones
should
grow
to
such
odd
shapes
his
flowers
the
purple
bells

all
the

clym
he
gazed
upon
the
wide
prospect
as
he
walked
and
was
glad
to
many
persons
this
egdon
was
a
place
which
had
slipped
out
of
its
century
generations
ago
to
intrude
as
an
uncouth
object
into
this
it
was
an
obsolete
thing
and
few
cared
to
study
it
how
could
this
be
otherwise
in
the
days
of
square
fields
plashed
hedges
and
meadows
watered
on
a
plan
so
rectangular
that
on
a
fine
day
they
looked
like
silver
gridirons
the
farmer
in
his
ride
who
could
smile
at
artificial
grasses
look
with
solicitude
at
the
coming
corn
and
sigh
with
sadness
at
the
fly
eaten
turnips
bestowed
upon
the
distant
upland
of
heath
nothing
better
than
a
frown
but
as
for
yeobright
when
he
looked
from
the
heights
on
his
way
he
could
not
help
indulging
in
a
barbarous
satisfaction
at
observing
that
in
some
of
the
attempts
at
reclamation
from
the
waste
tillage
after
holding
on
for
a
year
or
two
had
receded
again
in
despair
the
ferns
and
furze
tufts
stubbornly
reasserting
themselves
he
descended
into
the
valley
and
soon
reached
his
home
at
blooms
end
his
mother
was
snipping
dead
leaves
from
the
window
plants
she
looked
up
at
him
as
if
she
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
his
long
stay
with
her
her
face
had
worn
that
look
for
several
days
he
could
perceive
that
the
curiosity
which
had
been
shown
by
the
hair
cutting
group
amounted
in
his
mother
to
concern
but
she
had
asked
no
question
with
her
lips
even
when
the
arrival
of
his
trunk
suggested
that
he
was
not
going
to
leave
her
soon
her
silence
besought
an
explanation
of
him
more
loudly
than
words
i
am
not
going
back
to
paris
again
mother
he
said
at
least
in
my
old
capacity
i
have
given
up
the
business
mrs
yeobright
turned
in
pained
surprise
i
thought
something
was
amiss
because
of
the
boxes
i
wonder
you
did
not
tell
me
sooner
i
ought
to
have
done
it
but
i
have
been
in
doubt
whether
you
would
be
pleased
with
my
plan
i
was
not
quite
clear
on
a
few
points
myself
i
am
going
to
take
an
entirely
new
course
i
am
astonished
clym
how
can
you
want
to
do
better
than
you
ve
been
doing
very
easily
but
i
shall
not
do
better
in
the
way
you
mean
i
suppose
it
will
be
called
doing
worse
but
i
hate
that
business
of
mine
and
i
want
to
do
some
worthy
thing
before
i
die
as
a
schoolmaster
i
think
to
do
it
a
school
master
to
the
poor
and
ignorant
to
teach
them
what
nobody
else
will
after
all
the
trouble
that
has
been
taken
to
give
you
a
start
and
when
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
to
keep
straight
on
towards
affluence
you
say
you
will
be
a
poor
man
s
schoolmaster
your
fancies
will
be
your
ruin
clym
mrs
yeobright
spoke
calmly
but
the
force
of
feeling
behind
the
words
was
but
too
apparent
to
one
who
knew
her
as
well
as
her
son
did
he
did
not
answer
there
was
in
his
face
that
hopelessness
of
being
understood
which
comes
when
the
objector
is
constitutionally
beyond
the
reach
of
a
logic
that
even
under
favouring
conditions
is
almost
too
coarse
a
vehicle
for
the
subtlety
of
the
argument
no
more
was
said
on
the
subject
till
the
end
of
dinner
his
mother
then
began
as
if
there
had
been
no
interval
since
the
morning
it
disturbs
me
clym
to
find
that
you
have
come
home
with
such
thoughts
as
those
i
hadn
t
the
least
idea
that
you
meant
to
go
backward
in
the
world
by
your
own
free
choice
of
course
i
have
always
supposed
you
were
going
to
push
straight
on
as
other
men
do
all
who
deserve
the
name
when
they
have
been
put
in
a
good
way
of
doing
well
i
cannot
help
it
said
clym
in
a
troubled
tone
mother
i
hate
the
flashy
business
talk
about
men
who
deserve
the
name
can
any
man
deserving
the
name
waste
his
time
in
that
effeminate
way
when
he
sees
half
the
world
going
to
ruin
for
want
of
somebody
to
buckle
to
and
teach
them
how
to
breast
the
misery
they
are
born
to
i
get
up
every
morning
and
see
the
whole
creation
groaning
and
travailing
in
pain
as
st
paul
says
and
yet
there
am
i
trafficking
in
glittering
splendours
with
wealthy
women
and
titled
libertines
and
pandering
to
the
meanest
vanities
i
who
have
health
and
strength
enough
for
anything
i
have
been
troubled
in
my
mind
about
it
all
the
year
and
the
end
is
that
i
cannot
do
it
any
more
why
can
t
you
do
it
as
well
as
others
i
don
t
know
except
that
there
are
many
things
other
people
care
for
which
i
don
t
and
that
s
partly
why
i
think
i
ought
to
do
this
for
one
thing
my
body
does
not
require
much
of
me
i
cannot
enjoy
delicacies
good
things
are
wasted
upon
me
well
i
ought
to
turn
that
defect
to
advantage
and
by
being
able
to
do
without
what
other
people
require
i
can
spend
what
such
things
cost
upon
anybody
else
now
yeobright
having
inherited
some
of
these
very
instincts
from
the
woman
before
him
could
not
fail
to
awaken
a
reciprocity
in
her
through
her
feelings
if
not
by
arguments
disguise
it
as
she
might
for
his
good
she
spoke
with
less
assurance
and
yet
you
might
have
been
a
wealthy
man
if
you
had
only
persevered
manager
to
that
large
diamond
establishment
what
better
can
a
man
wish
for
what
a
post
of
trust
and
respect
i
suppose
you
will
be
like
your
father
like
him
you
are
getting
weary
of
doing
well
no
said
her
son
i
am
not
weary
of
that
though
i
am
weary
of
what
you
mean
by
it
mother
what
is
doing
well
mrs
yeobright
was
far
too
thoughtful
a
woman
to
be
content
with
ready
definitions
and
like
the
what
is
wisdom
of
plato
s
socrates
and
the
what
is
truth
of
pontius
pilate
yeobright
s
burning
question
received
no
answer
the
silence
was
broken
by
the
clash
of
the
garden
gate
a
tap
at
the
door
and
its
opening
christian
cantle
appeared
in
the
room
in
his
sunday
clothes
it
was
the
custom
on
egdon
to
begin
the
preface
to
a
story
before
absolutely
entering
the
house
so
as
to
be
well
in
for
the
body
of
the
narrative
by
the
time
visitor
and
visited
stood
face
to
face
christian
had
been
saying
to
them
while
the
door
was
leaving
its
latch
to
think
that
i
who
go
from
home
but
once
in
a
while
and
hardly
then
should
have
been
there
this
morning
tis
news
you
have
brought
us
then
christian
said
mrs
yeobright
ay
sure
about
a
witch
and
ye
must
overlook
my
time
o
day
for
says
i
i
must
go
and
tell
em
though
they
won
t
have
half
done
dinner
i
assure
ye
it
made
me
shake
like
a
driven
leaf
do
ye
think
any
harm
will
come
o
t
well
what
this
morning
at
church
we
was
all
standing
up
and
the
pa
son
said
let
us
pray
well
thinks
i
one
may
as
well
kneel
as
stand
so
down
i
went
and
more
than
that
all
the
rest
were
as
willing
to
oblige
the
man
as
i
we
hadn
t
been
hard
at
it
for
more
than
a
minute
when
a
most
terrible
screech
sounded
through
church
as
if
somebody
had
just
gied
up
their
heart
s
blood
all
the
folk
jumped
up
and
then
we
found
that
susan
nunsuch
had
pricked
miss
vye
with
a
long
stocking
needle
as
she
had
threatened
to
do
as
soon
as
ever
she
could
get
the
young
lady
to
church
where
she
don
t
come
very
often
she
ve
waited
for
this
chance
for
weeks
so
as
to
draw
her
blood
and
put
an
end
to
the
bewitching
of
susan
s
children
that
has
been
carried
on
so
long
sue
followed
her
into
church
sat
next
to
her
and
as
soon
as
she
could
find
a
chance
in
went
the
stocking
needle
into
my
lady
s
arm
good
heaven
how
horrid
said
mrs
yeobright
sue
pricked
her
that
deep
that
the
maid
fainted
away
and
as
i
was
afeard
there
might
be
some
tumult
among
us
i
got
behind
the
bass
viol
and
didn
t
see
no
more
but
they
carried
her
out
into
the
air
tis
said
but
when
they
looked
round
for
sue
she
was
gone
what
a
scream
that
girl
gied
poor
thing
there
were
the
pa
son
in
his
surplice
holding
up
his
hand
and
saying
sit
down
my
good
people
sit
down
but
the
deuce
a
bit
would
they
sit
down
o
and
what
d
ye
think
i
found
out
mrs
yeobright
the
pa
son
wears
a
suit
of
clothes
under
his
surplice
i
could
see
his
black
sleeves
when
he
held
up
his
arm
tis
a
cruel
thing
said
yeobright
yes
said
his
mother
the
nation
ought
to
look
into
it
said
christian
here
s
humphrey
coming
i
think
in
came
humphrey
well
have
ye
heard
the
news
but
i
see
you
have
tis
a
very
strange
thing
that
whenever
one
of
egdon
folk
goes
to
church
some
rum
job
or
other
is
sure
to
be
doing
the
last
time
one
of
us
was
there
was
when
neighbour
fairway
went
in
the
fall
and
that
was
the
day
you
forbad
the
banns
mrs
yeobright
has
this
cruelly
treated
girl
been
able
to
walk
home
said
clym
they
say
she
got
better
and
went
home
very
well
and
now
i
ve
told
it
i
must
be
moving
homeward
myself
and
i
said
humphrey
truly
now
we
shall
see
if
there
s
anything
in
what
folks
say
about
her
when
they
were
gone
into
the
heath
again
yeobright
said
quietly
to
his
mother
do
you
think
i
have
turned
teacher
too
soon
it
is
right
that
there
should
be
schoolmasters
and
missionaries
and
all
such
men
she
replied
but
it
is
right
too
that
i
should
try
to
lift
you
out
of
this
life
into
something
richer
and
that
you
should
not
come
back
again
and
be
as
if
i
had
not
tried
at
all
later
in
the
day
sam
the
turf
cutter
entered
i
ve
come
a
borrowing
mrs
yeobright
i
suppose
you
have
heard
what
s
been
happening
to
the
beauty
on
the
hill
yes
sam
half
a
dozen
have
been
telling
us
beauty
said
clym
yes
tolerably
well
favoured
sam
replied
lord
all
the
country
owns
that
tis
one
of
the
strangest
things
in
the
world
that
such
a
woman
should
have
come
to
live
up
there
dark
or
fair
now
though
i
ve
seen
her
twenty
times
that
s
a
thing
i
cannot
call
to
mind
darker
than
tamsin
murmured
mrs
yeobright
a
woman
who
seems
to
care
for
nothing
at
all
as
you
may
say
she
is
melancholy
then
inquired
clym
she
mopes
about
by
herself
and
don
t
mix
in
with
the
people
is
she
a
young
lady
inclined
for
adventures
not
to
my
knowledge
doesn
t
join
in
with
the
lads
in
their
games
to
get
some
sort
of
excitement
in
this
lonely
place
no
mumming
for
instance
no
her
notions
be
different
i
should
rather
say
her
thoughts
were
far
away
from
here
with
lords
and
ladies
she
ll
never
know
and
mansions
she
ll
never
see
again
observing
that
clym
appeared
singularly
interested
mrs
yeobright
said
rather
uneasily
to
sam
you
see
more
in
her
than
most
of
us
do
miss
vye
is
to
my
mind
too
idle
to
be
charming
i
have
never
heard
that
she
is
of
any
use
to
herself
or
to
other
people
good
girls
don
t
get
treated
as
witches
even
on
egdon
nonsense
that
proves
nothing
either
way
said
yeobright
well
of
course
i
don
t
understand
such
niceties
said
sam
withdrawing
from
a
possibly
unpleasant
argument
and
what
she
is
we
must
wait
for
time
to
tell
us
the
business
that
i
have
really
called
about
is
this
to
borrow
the
longest
and
strongest
rope
you
have
the
captain
s
bucket
has
dropped
into
the
well
and
they
are
in
want
of
water
and
as
all
the
chaps
are
at
home
today
we
think
we
can
get
it
out
for
him
we
have
three
cart
ropes
already
but
they
won
t
reach
to
the
bottom
mrs
yeobright
told
him
that
he
might
have
whatever
ropes
he
could
find
in
the
outhouse
and
sam
went
out
to
search
when
he
passed
by
the
door
clym
joined
him
and
accompanied
him
to
the
gate
is
this
young
witch
lady
going
to
stay
long
at
mistover
he
asked
i
should
say
so
what
a
cruel
shame
to
ill
use
her
she
must
have
suffered
greatly
more
in
mind
than
in
body
twas
a
graceless
trick
such
a
handsome
girl
too
you
ought
to
see
her
mr
yeobright
being
a
young
man
come
from
far
and
with
a
little
more
to
show
for
your
years
than
most
of
us
do
you
think
she
would
like
to
teach
children
said
clym
sam
shook
his
head
quite
a
different
sort
of
body
from
that
i
reckon
o
it
was
merely
something
which
occurred
to
me
it
would
of
course
be
necessary
to
see
her
and
talk
it
over
not
an
easy
thing
by
the
way
for
my
family
and
hers
are
not
very
friendly
i
ll
tell
you
how
you
mid
see
her
mr
yeobright
said
sam
we
are
going
to
grapple
for
the
bucket
at
six
o
clock
tonight
at
her
house
and
you
could
lend
a
hand
there
s
five
or
six
coming
but
the
well
is
deep
and
another
might
be
useful
if
you
don
t
mind
appearing
in
that
shape
she
s
sure
to
be
walking
round
i
ll
think
of
it
said
yeobright
and
they
parted
he
thought
of
it
a
good
deal
but
nothing
more
was
said
about
eustacia
inside
the
house
at
that
time
whether
this
romantic
martyr
to
superstition
and
the
melancholy
mummer
he
had
conversed
with
under
the
full
moon
were
one
and
the
same
person
remained
as
yet
a
problem
the
first
act
in
a
timeworn
drama
the
afternoon
was
fine
and
yeobright
walked
on
the
heath
for
an
hour
with
his
mother
when
they
reached
the
lofty
ridge
which
divided
the
valley
of
blooms
end
from
the
adjoining
valley
they
stood
still
and
looked
round
the
quiet
woman
inn
was
visible
on
the
low
margin
of
the
heath
in
one
direction
and
afar
on
the
other
hand
rose
mistover
knap
you
mean
to
call
on
thomasin
he
inquired
yes
but
you
need
not
come
this
time
said
his
mother
in
that
case
i
ll
branch
off
here
mother
i
am
going
to
mistover
mrs
yeobright
turned
to
him
inquiringly
i
am
going
to
help
them
get
the
bucket
out
of
the
captain
s
well
he
continued
as
it
is
so
very
deep
i
may
be
useful
and
i
should
like
to
see
this
miss
vye
not
so
much
for
her
good
looks
as
for
another
reason
must
you
go
his
mother
asked
i
thought
to
and
they
parted
there
is
no
help
for
it
murmured
clym
s
mother
gloomily
as
he
withdrew
they
are
sure
to
see
each
other
i
wish
sam
would
carry
his
news
to
other
houses
than
mine
clym
s
retreating
figure
got
smaller
and
smaller
as
it
rose
and
fell
over
the
hillocks
on
his
way
he
is
tender
hearted
said
mrs
yeobright
to
herself
while
she
watched
him
otherwise
it
would
matter
little
how
he
s
going
on
he
was
indeed
walking
with
a
will
over
the
furze
as
straight
as
a
line
as
if
his
life
depended
upon
it
his
mother
drew
a
long
breath
and
abandoning
the
visit
to
thomasin
turned
back
the
evening
films
began
to
make
nebulous
pictures
of
the
valleys
but
the
high
lands
still
were
raked
by
the
declining
rays
of
the
winter
sun
which
glanced
on
clym
as
he
walked
forward
eyed
by
every
rabbit
and
field
fare
around
a
long
shadow
advancing
in
front
of
him
on
drawing
near
to
the
furze
covered
bank
and
ditch
which
fortified
the
captain
s
dwelling
he
could
hear
voices
within
signifying
that
operations
had
been
already
begun
at
the
side
entrance
gate
he
stopped
and
looked
over
half
a
dozen
able
bodied
men
were
standing
in
a
line
from
the
well
mouth
holding
a
rope
which
passed
over
the
well
roller
into
the
depths
below
fairway
with
a
piece
of
smaller
rope
round
his
body
made
fast
to
one
of
the
standards
to
guard
against
accidents
was
leaning
over
the
opening
his
right
hand
clasping
the
vertical
rope
that
descended
into
the
well
now
silence
folks
said
fairway
the
talking
ceased
and
fairway
gave
a
circular
motion
to
the
rope
as
if
he
were
stirring
batter
at
the
end
of
a
minute
a
dull
splashing
reverberated
from
the
bottom
of
the
well
the
helical
twist
he
had
imparted
to
the
rope
had
reached
the
grapnel
below
haul
said
fairway
and
the
men
who
held
the
rope
began
to
gather
it
over
the
wheel
i
think
we
ve
got
sommat
said
one
of
the
haulers
in
then
pull
steady
said
fairway
they
gathered
up
more
and
more
till
a
regular
dripping
into
the
well
could
be
heard
below
it
grew
smarter
with
the
increasing
height
of
the
bucket
and
presently
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
of
rope
had
been
pulled
in
fairway
then
lit
a
lantern
tied
it
to
another
cord
and
began
lowering
it
into
the
well
beside
the
first
clym
came
forward
and
looked
down
strange
humid
leaves
which
knew
nothing
of
the
seasons
of
the
year
and
quaint
natured
mosses
were
revealed
on
the
wellside
as
the
lantern
descended
till
its
rays
fell
upon
a
confused
mass
of
rope
and
bucket
dangling
in
the
dank
dark
air
we
ve
only
got
en
by
the
edge
of
the
hoop
steady
for
god
s
sake
said
fairway
they
pulled
with
the
greatest
gentleness
till
the
wet
bucket
appeared
about
two
yards
below
them
like
a
dead
friend
come
to
earth
again
three
or
four
hands
were
stretched
out
then
jerk
went
the
rope
whizz
went
the
wheel
the
two
foremost
haulers
fell
backward
the
beating
of
a
falling
body
was
heard
receding
down
the
sides
of
the
well
and
a
thunderous
uproar
arose
at
the
bottom
the
bucket
was
gone
again
damn
the
bucket
said
fairway
lower
again
said
sam
i
m
as
stiff
as
a
ram
s
horn
stooping
so
long
said
fairway
standing
up
and
stretching
himself
till
his
joints
creaked
rest
a
few
minutes
timothy
said
yeobright
i
ll
take
your
place
the
grapnel
was
again
lowered
its
smart
impact
upon
the
distant
water
reached
their
ears
like
a
kiss
whereupon
yeobright
knelt
down
and
leaning
over
the
well
began
dragging
the
grapnel
round
and
round
as
fairway
had
done
tie
a
rope
round
him
it
is
dangerous
cried
a
soft
and
anxious
voice
somewhere
above
them
everybody
turned
the
speaker
was
a
woman
gazing
down
upon
the
group
from
an
upper
window
whose
panes
blazed
in
the
ruddy
glare
from
the
west
her
lips
were
parted
and
she
appeared
for
the
moment
to
forget
where
she
was
the
rope
was
accordingly
tied
round
his
waist
and
the
work
proceeded
at
the
next
haul
the
weight
was
not
heavy
and
it
was
discovered
that
they
had
only
secured
a
coil
of
the
rope
detached
from
the
bucket
the
tangled
mass
was
thrown
into
the
background
humphrey
took
yeobright
s
place
and
the
grapnel
was
lowered
again
yeobright
retired
to
the
heap
of
recovered
rope
in
a
meditative
mood
of
the
identity
between
the
lady
s
voice
and
that
of
the
melancholy
mummer
he
had
not
a
moment
s
doubt
how
thoughtful
of
her
he
said
to
himself
eustacia
who
had
reddened
when
she
perceived
the
effect
of
her
exclamation
upon
the
group
below
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
at
the
window
though
yeobright
scanned
it
wistfully
while
he
stood
there
the
men
at
the
well
succeeded
in
getting
up
the
bucket
without
a
mishap
one
of
them
went
to
inquire
for
the
captain
to
learn
what
orders
he
wished
to
give
for
mending
the
well
tackle
the
captain
proved
to
be
away
from
home
and
eustacia
appeared
at
the
door
and
came
out
she
had
lapsed
into
an
easy
and
dignified
calm
far
removed
from
the
intensity
of
life
in
her
words
of
solicitude
for
clym
s
safety
will
it
be
possible
to
draw
water
here
tonight
she
inquired
no
miss
the
bottom
of
the
bucket
is
clean
knocked
out
and
as
we
can
do
no
more
now
we
ll
leave
off
and
come
again
tomorrow
morning
no
water
she
murmured
turning
away
i
can
send
you
up
some
from
blooms
end
said
clym
coming
forward
and
raising
his
hat
as
the
men
retired
yeobright
and
eustacia
looked
at
each
other
for
one
instant
as
if
each
had
in
mind
those
few
moments
during
which
a
certain
moonlight
scene
was
common
to
both
with
the
glance
the
calm
fixity
of
her
features
sublimed
itself
to
an
expression
of
refinement
and
warmth
it
was
like
garish
noon
rising
to
the
dignity
of
sunset
in
a
couple
of
seconds
thank
you
it
will
hardly
be
necessary
she
replied
but
if
you
have
no
water
well
it
is
what
i
call
no
water
she
said
blushing
and
lifting
her
long
lashed
eyelids
as
if
to
lift
them
were
a
work
requiring
consideration
but
my
grandfather
calls
it
water
enough
i
ll
show
you
what
i
mean
she
moved
away
a
few
yards
and
clym
followed
when
she
reached
the
corner
of
the
enclosure
where
the
steps
were
formed
for
mounting
the
boundary
bank
she
sprang
up
with
a
lightness
which
seemed
strange
after
her
listless
movement
towards
the
well
it
incidentally
showed
that
her
apparent
languor
did
not
arise
from
lack
of
force
clym
ascended
behind
her
and
noticed
a
circular
burnt
patch
at
the
top
of
the
bank
ashes
he
said
yes
said
eustacia
we
had
a
little
bonfire
here
last
fifth
of
november
and
those
are
the
marks
of
it
on
that
spot
had
stood
the
fire
she
had
kindled
to
attract
wildeve
that
s
the
only
kind
of
water
we
have
she
continued
tossing
a
stone
into
the
pool
which
lay
on
the
outside
of
the
bank
like
the
white
of
an
eye
without
its
pupil
the
stone
fell
with
a
flounce
but
no
wildeve
appeared
on
the
other
side
as
on
a
previous
occasion
there
my
grandfather
says
he
lived
for
more
than
twenty
years
at
sea
on
water
twice
as
bad
as
that
she
went
on
and
considers
it
quite
good
enough
for
us
here
on
an
emergency
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
no
impurities
in
the
water
of
these
pools
at
this
time
of
the
year
it
has
only
just
rained
into
them
she
shook
her
head
i
am
managing
to
exist
in
a
wilderness
but
i
cannot
drink
from
a
pond
she
said
clym
looked
towards
the
well
which
was
now
deserted
the
men
having
gone
home
it
is
a
long
way
to
send
for
spring
water
he
said
after
a
silence
but
since
you
don
t
like
this
in
the
pond
i
ll
try
to
get
you
some
myself
he
went
back
to
the
well
yes
i
think
i
could
do
it
by
tying
on
this
pail
but
since
i
would
not
trouble
the
men
to
get
it
i
cannot
in
conscience
let
you
i
don
t
mind
the
trouble
at
all
he
made
fast
the
pail
to
the
long
coil
of
rope
put
it
over
the
wheel
and
allowed
it
to
descend
by
letting
the
rope
slip
through
his
hands
before
it
had
gone
far
however
he
checked
it
i
must
make
fast
the
end
first
or
we
may
lose
the
whole
he
said
to
eustacia
who
had
drawn
near
could
you
hold
this
a
moment
while
i
do
it
or
shall
i
call
your
servant
i
can
hold
it
said
eustacia
and
he
placed
the
rope
in
her
hands
going
then
to
search
for
the
end
i
suppose
i
may
let
it
slip
down
she
inquired
i
would
advise
you
not
to
let
it
go
far
said
clym
it
will
get
much
heavier
you
will
find
however
eustacia
had
begun
to
pay
out
while
he
was
tying
she
cried
i
cannot
stop
it
clym
ran
to
her
side
and
found
he
could
only
check
the
rope
by
twisting
the
loose
part
round
the
upright
post
when
it
stopped
with
a
jerk
has
it
hurt
you
yes
she
replied
very
much
no
i
think
not
she
opened
her
hands
one
of
them
was
bleeding
the
rope
had
dragged
off
the
skin
eustacia
wrapped
it
in
her
handkerchief
you
should
have
let
go
said
yeobright
why
didn
t
you
you
said
i
was
to
hold
on
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
been
wounded
today
ah
yes
i
have
heard
of
it
i
blush
for
my
native
egdon
was
it
a
serious
injury
you
received
in
church
miss
vye
there
was
such
an
abundance
of
sympathy
in
clym
s
tone
that
eustacia
slowly
drew
up
her
sleeve
and
disclosed
her
round
white
arm
a
bright
red
spot
appeared
on
its
smooth
surface
like
a
ruby
on
parian
marble
there
it
is
she
said
putting
her
finger
against
the
spot
it
was
dastardly
of
the
woman
said
clym
will
not
captain
vye
get
her
punished
he
is
gone
from
home
on
that
very
business
i
did
not
know
that
i
had
such
a
magic
reputation
and
you
fainted
said
clym
looking
at
the
scarlet
little
puncture
as
if
he
would
like
to
kiss
it
and
make
it
well
yes
it
frightened
me
i
had
not
been
to
church
for
a
long
time
and
now
i
shall
not
go
again
for
ever
so
long
perhaps
never
i
cannot
face
their
eyes
after
this
don
t
you
think
it
dreadfully
humiliating
i
wished
i
was
dead
for
hours
after
but
i
don
t
mind
now
i
have
come
to
clean
away
these
cobwebs
said
yeobright
would
you
like
to
help
me
by
high
class
teaching
we
might
benefit
them
much
i
don
t
quite
feel
anxious
to
i
have
not
much
love
for
my
fellow
creatures
sometimes
i
quite
hate
them
still
i
think
that
if
you
were
to
hear
my
scheme
you
might
take
an
interest
in
it
there
is
no
use
in
hating
people
if
you
hate
anything
you
should
hate
what
produced
them
do
you
mean
nature
i
hate
her
already
but
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
your
scheme
at
any
time
the
situation
had
now
worked
itself
out
and
the
next
natural
thing
was
for
them
to
part
clym
knew
this
well
enough
and
eustacia
made
a
move
of
conclusion
yet
he
looked
at
her
as
if
he
had
one
word
more
to
say
perhaps
if
he
had
not
lived
in
paris
it
would
never
have
been
uttered
we
have
met
before
he
said
regarding
her
with
rather
more
interest
than
was
necessary
i
do
not
own
it
said
eustacia
with
a
repressed
still
look
but
i
may
think
what
i
like
yes
you
are
lonely
here
i
cannot
endure
the
heath
except
in
its
purple
season
the
heath
is
a
cruel
taskmaster
to
me
can
you
say
so
he
asked
to
my
mind
it
is
most
exhilarating
and
strengthening
and
soothing
i
would
rather
live
on
these
hills
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
it
is
well
enough
for
artists
but
i
never
would
learn
to
draw
and
there
is
a
very
curious
druidical
stone
just
out
there
he
threw
a
pebble
in
the
direction
signified
do
you
often
go
to
see
it
i
was
not
even
aware
there
existed
any
such
curious
druidical
stone
i
am
aware
that
there
are
boulevards
in
paris
yeobright
looked
thoughtfully
on
the
ground
that
means
much
he
said
it
does
indeed
said
eustacia
i
remember
when
i
had
the
same
longing
for
town
bustle
five
years
of
a
great
city
would
be
a
perfect
cure
for
that
heaven
send
me
such
a
cure
now
mr
yeobright
i
will
go
indoors
and
plaster
my
wounded
hand
they
separated
and
eustacia
vanished
in
the
increasing
shade
she
seemed
full
of
many
things
her
past
was
a
blank
her
life
had
begun
the
effect
upon
clym
of
this
meeting
he
did
not
fully
discover
till
some
time
after
during
his
walk
home
his
most
intelligible
sensation
was
that
his
scheme
had
somehow
become
glorified
a
beautiful
woman
had
been
intertwined
with
it
on
reaching
the
house
he
went
up
to
the
room
which
was
to
be
made
his
study
and
occupied
himself
during
the
evening
in
unpacking
his
books
from
the
boxes
and
arranging
them
on
shelves
from
another
box
he
drew
a
lamp
and
a
can
of
oil
he
trimmed
the
lamp
arranged
his
table
and
said
now
i
am
ready
to
begin
he
rose
early
the
next
morning
read
two
hours
before
breakfast
by
the
light
of
his
lamp
read
all
the
morning
all
the
afternoon
just
when
the
sun
was
going
down
his
eyes
felt
weary
and
he
leant
back
in
his
chair
his
room
overlooked
the
front
of
the
premises
and
the
valley
of
the
heath
beyond
the
lowest
beams
of
the
winter
sun
threw
the
shadow
of
the
house
over
the
palings
across
the
grass
margin
of
the
heath
and
far
up
the
vale
where
the
chimney
outlines
and
those
of
the
surrounding
tree
tops
stretched
forth
in
long
dark
prongs
having
been
seated
at
work
all
day
he
decided
to
take
a
turn
upon
the
hills
before
it
got
dark
and
going
out
forthwith
he
struck
across
the
heath
towards
mistover
it
was
an
hour
and
a
half
later
when
he
again
appeared
at
the
garden
gate
the
shutters
of
the
house
were
closed
and
christian
cantle
who
had
been
wheeling
manure
about
the
garden
all
day
had
gone
home
on
entering
he
found
that
his
mother
after
waiting
a
long
time
for
him
had
finished
her
meal
where
have
you
been
clym
she
immediately
said
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
that
you
were
going
away
at
this
time
i
have
been
on
the
heath
you
ll
meet
eustacia
vye
if
you
go
up
there
clym
paused
a
minute
yes
i
met
her
this
evening
he
said
as
though
it
were
spoken
under
the
sheer
necessity
of
preserving
honesty
i
wondered
if
you
had
it
was
no
appointment
no
such
meetings
never
are
but
you
are
not
angry
mother
i
can
hardly
say
that
i
am
not
angry
no
but
when
i
consider
the
usual
nature
of
the
drag
which
causes
men
of
promise
to
disappoint
the
world
i
feel
uneasy
you
deserve
credit
for
the
feeling
mother
but
i
can
assure
you
that
you
need
not
be
disturbed
by
it
on
my
account
when
i
think
of
you
and
your
new
crotchets
said
mrs
yeobright
with
some
emphasis
i
naturally
don
t
feel
so
comfortable
as
i
did
a
twelvemonth
ago
it
is
incredible
to
me
that
a
man
accustomed
to
the
attractive
women
of
paris
and
elsewhere
should
be
so
easily
worked
upon
by
a
girl
in
a
heath
you
could
just
as
well
have
walked
another
way
i
had
been
studying
all
day
well
yes
she
added
more
hopefully
i
have
been
thinking
that
you
might
get
on
as
a
schoolmaster
and
rise
that
way
since
you
really
are
determined
to
hate
the
course
you
were
pursuing
yeobright
was
unwilling
to
disturb
this
idea
though
his
scheme
was
far
enough
removed
from
one
wherein
the
education
of
youth
should
be
made
a
mere
channel
of
social
ascent
he
had
no
desires
of
that
sort
he
had
reached
the
stage
in
a
young
man
s
life
when
the
grimness
of
the
general
human
situation
first
becomes
clear
and
the
realization
of
this
causes
ambition
to
halt
awhile
in
france
it
is
not
uncustomary
to
commit
suicide
at
this
stage
in
england
we
do
much
better
or
much
worse
as
the
case
may
be
the
love
between
the
young
man
and
his
mother
was
strangely
invisible
now
of
love
it
may
be
said
the
less
earthly
the
less
demonstrative
in
its
absolutely
indestructible
form
it
reaches
a
profundity
in
which
all
exhibition
of
itself
is
painful
it
was
so
with
these
had
conversations
between
them
been
overheard
people
would
have
said
how
cold
they
are
to
each
other
his
theory
and
his
wishes
about
devoting
his
future
to
teaching
had
made
an
impression
on
mrs
yeobright
indeed
how
could
it
be
otherwise
when
he
was
a
part
of
her
when
their
discourses
were
as
if
carried
on
between
the
right
and
the
left
hands
of
the
same
body
he
had
despaired
of
reaching
her
by
argument
and
it
was
almost
as
a
discovery
to
him
that
he
could
reach
her
by
a
magnetism
which
was
as
superior
to
words
as
words
are
to
yells
strangely
enough
he
began
to
feel
now
that
it
would
not
be
so
hard
to
persuade
her
who
was
his
best
friend
that
comparative
poverty
was
essentially
the
higher
course
for
him
as
to
reconcile
to
his
feelings
the
act
of
persuading
her
from
every
provident
point
of
view
his
mother
was
so
undoubtedly
right
that
he
was
not
without
a
sickness
of
heart
in
finding
he
could
shake
her
she
had
a
singular
insight
into
life
considering
that
she
had
never
mixed
with
it
there
are
instances
of
persons
who
without
clear
ideas
of
the
things
they
criticize
have
yet
had
clear
ideas
of
the
relations
of
those
things
blacklock
a
poet
blind
from
his
birth
could
describe
visual
objects
with
accuracy
professor
sanderson
who
was
also
blind
gave
excellent
lectures
on
colour
and
taught
others
the
theory
of
ideas
which
they
had
and
he
had
not
in
the
social
sphere
these
gifted
ones
are
mostly
women
they
can
watch
a
world
which
they
never
saw
and
estimate
forces
of
which
they
have
only
heard
we
call
it
intuition
what
was
the
great
world
to
mrs
yeobright
a
multitude
whose
tendencies
could
be
perceived
though
not
its
essences
communities
were
seen
by
her
as
from
a
distance
she
saw
them
as
we
see
the
throngs
which
cover
the
canvases
of
sallaert
van
alsloot
and
others
of
that
school
vast
masses
of
beings
jostling
zigzagging
and
processioning
in
definite
directions
but
whose
features
are
indistinguishable
by
the
very
comprehensiveness
of
the
view
one
could
see
that
as
far
as
it
had
gone
her
life
was
very
complete
on
its
reflective
side
the
philosophy
of
her
nature
and
its
limitation
by
circumstances
was
almost
written
in
her
movements
they
had
a
majestic
foundation
though
they
were
far
from
being
majestic
and
they
had
a
ground
work
of
assurance
but
they
were
not
assured
as
her
once
elastic
walk
had
become
deadened
by
time
so
had
her
natural
pride
of
life
been
hindered
in
its
blooming
by
her
necessities
the
next
slight
touch
in
the
shaping
of
clym
s
destiny
occurred
a
few
days
after
a
barrow
was
opened
on
the
heath
and
yeobright
attended
the
operation
remaining
away
from
his
study
during
several
hours
in
the
afternoon
christian
returned
from
a
journey
in
the
same
direction
and
mrs
yeobright
questioned
him
they
have
dug
a
hole
and
they
have
found
things
like
flowerpots
upside
down
mis
ess
yeobright
and
inside
these
be
real
charnel
bones
they
have
carried
em
off
to
men
s
houses
but
i
shouldn
t
like
to
sleep
where
they
will
bide
dead
folks
have
been
known
to
come
and
claim
their
own
mr
yeobright
had
got
one
pot
of
the
bones
and
was
going
to
bring
em
home
real
skellington
bones
but
twas
ordered
otherwise
you
ll
be
relieved
to
hear
that
he
gave
away
his
pot
and
all
on
second
thoughts
and
a
blessed
thing
for
ye
mis
ess
yeobright
considering
the
wind
o
nights
gave
it
away
yes
to
miss
vye
she
has
a
cannibal
taste
for
such
churchyard
furniture
seemingly
miss
vye
was
there
too
ay
a
b
lieve
she
was
when
clym
came
home
which
was
shortly
after
his
mother
said
in
a
curious
tone
the
urn
you
had
meant
for
me
you
gave
away
yeobright
made
no
reply
the
current
of
her
feeling
was
too
pronounced
to
admit
it
the
early
weeks
of
the
year
passed
on
yeobright
certainly
studied
at
home
but
he
also
walked
much
abroad
and
the
direction
of
his
walk
was
always
towards
some
point
of
a
line
between
mistover
and
rainbarrow
the
month
of
march
arrived
and
the
heath
showed
its
first
signs
of
awakening
from
winter
trance
the
awakening
was
almost
feline
in
its
stealthiness
the
pool
outside
the
bank
by
eustacia
s
dwelling
which
seemed
as
dead
and
desolate
as
ever
to
an
observer
who
moved
and
made
noises
in
his
observation
would
gradually
disclose
a
state
of
great
animation
when
silently
watched
awhile
a
timid
animal
world
had
come
to
life
for
the
season
little
tadpoles
and
efts
began
to
bubble
up
through
the
water
and
to
race
along
beneath
it
toads
made
noises
like
very
young
ducks
and
advanced
to
the
margin
in
twos
and
threes
overhead
bumblebees
flew
hither
and
thither
in
the
thickening
light
their
drone
coming
and
going
like
the
sound
of
a
gong
on
an
evening
such
as
this
yeobright
descended
into
the
blooms
end
valley
from
beside
that
very
pool
where
he
had
been
standing
with
another
person
quite
silently
and
quite
long
enough
to
hear
all
this
puny
stir
of
resurrection
in
nature
yet
he
had
not
heard
it
his
walk
was
rapid
as
he
came
down
and
he
went
with
a
springy
trend
before
entering
upon
his
mother
s
premises
he
stopped
and
breathed
the
light
which
shone
forth
on
him
from
the
window
revealed
that
his
face
was
flushed
and
his
eye
bright
what
it
did
not
show
was
something
which
lingered
upon
his
lips
like
a
seal
set
there
the
abiding
presence
of
this
impress
was
so
real
that
he
hardly
dared
to
enter
the
house
for
it
seemed
as
if
his
mother
might
say
what
red
spot
is
that
glowing
upon
your
mouth
so
vividly
but
he
entered
soon
after
the
tea
was
ready
and
he
sat
down
opposite
his
mother
she
did
not
speak
many
words
and
as
for
him
something
had
been
just
done
and
some
words
had
been
just
said
on
the
hill
which
prevented
him
from
beginning
a
desultory
chat
his
mother
s
taciturnity
was
not
without
ominousness
but
he
appeared
not
to
care
he
knew
why
she
said
so
little
but
he
could
not
remove
the
cause
of
her
bearing
towards
him
these
half
silent
sittings
were
far
from
uncommon
with
them
now
at
last
yeobright
made
a
beginning
of
what
was
intended
to
strike
at
the
whole
root
of
the
matter
five
days
have
we
sat
like
this
at
meals
with
scarcely
a
word
what
s
the
use
of
it
mother
none
said
she
in
a
heart
swollen
tone
but
there
is
only
too
good
a
reason
not
when
you
know
all
i
have
been
wanting
to
speak
about
this
and
i
am
glad
the
subject
is
begun
the
reason
of
course
is
eustacia
vye
well
i
confess
i
have
seen
her
lately
and
have
seen
her
a
good
many
times
yes
yes
and
i
know
what
that
amounts
to
it
troubles
me
clym
you
are
wasting
your
life
here
and
it
is
solely
on
account
of
her
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
woman
you
would
never
have
entertained
this
teaching
scheme
at
all
clym
looked
hard
at
his
mother
you
know
that
is
not
it
he
said
well
i
know
you
had
decided
to
attempt
it
before
you
saw
her
but
that
would
have
ended
in
intentions
it
was
very
well
to
talk
of
but
ridiculous
to
put
in
practice
i
fully
expected
that
in
the
course
of
a
month
or
two
you
would
have
seen
the
folly
of
such
self
sacrifice
and
would
have
been
by
this
time
back
again
to
paris
in
some
business
or
other
i
can
understand
objections
to
the
diamond
trade
i
really
was
thinking
that
it
might
be
inadequate
to
the
life
of
a
man
like
you
even
though
it
might
have
made
you
a
millionaire
but
now
i
see
how
mistaken
you
are
about
this
girl
i
doubt
if
you
could
be
correct
about
other
things
how
am
i
mistaken
in
her
she
is
lazy
and
dissatisfied
but
that
is
not
all
of
it
supposing
her
to
be
as
good
a
woman
as
any
you
can
find
which
she
certainly
is
not
why
do
you
wish
to
connect
yourself
with
anybody
at
present
well
there
are
practical
reasons
clym
began
and
then
almost
broke
off
under
an
overpowering
sense
of
the
weight
of
argument
which
could
be
brought
against
his
statement
if
i
take
a
school
an
educated
woman
would
be
invaluable
as
a
help
to
me
what
you
really
mean
to
marry
her
it
would
be
premature
to
state
that
plainly
but
consider
what
obvious
advantages
there
would
be
in
doing
it
she
don
t
suppose
she
has
any
money
she
hasn
t
a
farthing
she
is
excellently
educated
and
would
make
a
good
matron
in
a
boarding
school
i
candidly
own
that
i
have
modified
my
views
a
little
in
deference
to
you
and
it
should
satisfy
you
i
no
longer
adhere
to
my
intention
of
giving
with
my
own
mouth
rudimentary
education
to
the
lowest
class
i
can
do
better
i
can
establish
a
good
private
school
for
farmers
sons
and
without
stopping
the
school
i
can
manage
to
pass
examinations
by
this
means
and
by
the
assistance
of
a
wife
like
her
oh
clym
i
shall
ultimately
i
hope
be
at
the
head
of
one
of
the
best
schools
in
the
county
yeobright
had
enunciated
the
word
her
with
a
fervour
which
in
conversation
with
a
mother
was
absurdly
indiscreet
hardly
a
maternal
heart
within
the
four
seas
could
in
such
circumstances
have
helped
being
irritated
at
that
ill
timed
betrayal
of
feeling
for
a
new
woman
you
are
blinded
clym
she
said
warmly
it
was
a
bad
day
for
you
when
you
first
set
eyes
on
her
and
your
scheme
is
merely
a
castle
in
the
air
built
on
purpose
to
justify
this
folly
which
has
seized
you
and
to
salve
your
conscience
on
the
irrational
situation
you
are
in
mother
that
s
not
true
he
firmly
answered
can
you
maintain
that
i
sit
and
tell
untruths
when
all
i
wish
to
do
is
to
save
you
from
sorrow
for
shame
clym
but
it
is
all
through
that
woman
a
hussy
clym
reddened
like
fire
and
rose
he
placed
his
hand
upon
his
mother
s
shoulder
and
said
in
a
tone
which
hung
strangely
between
entreaty
and
command
i
won
t
hear
it
i
may
be
led
to
answer
you
in
a
way
which
we
shall
both
regret
his
mother
parted
her
lips
to
begin
some
other
vehement
truth
but
on
looking
at
him
she
saw
that
in
his
face
which
led
her
to
leave
the
words
unsaid
yeobright
walked
once
or
twice
across
the
room
and
then
suddenly
went
out
of
the
house
it
was
eleven
o
clock
when
he
came
in
though
he
had
not
been
further
than
the
precincts
of
the
garden
his
mother
was
gone
to
bed
a
light
was
left
burning
on
the
table
and
supper
was
spread
without
stopping
for
any
food
he
secured
the
doors
and
went
upstairs
an
hour
of
bliss
and
many
hours
of
sadness
the
next
day
was
gloomy
enough
at
blooms
end
yeobright
remained
in
his
study
sitting
over
the
open
books
but
the
work
of
those
hours
was
miserably
scant
determined
that
there
should
be
nothing
in
his
conduct
towards
his
mother
resembling
sullenness
he
had
occasionally
spoken
to
her
on
passing
matters
and
would
take
no
notice
of
the
brevity
of
her
replies
with
the
same
resolve
to
keep
up
a
show
of
conversation
he
said
about
seven
o
clock
in
the
evening
there
s
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
tonight
i
am
going
out
to
see
it
and
putting
on
his
overcoat
he
left
her
the
low
moon
was
not
as
yet
visible
from
the
front
of
the
house
and
yeobright
climbed
out
of
the
valley
until
he
stood
in
the
full
flood
of
her
light
but
even
now
he
walked
on
and
his
steps
were
in
the
direction
of
rainbarrow
in
half
an
hour
he
stood
at
the
top
the
sky
was
clear
from
verge
to
verge
and
the
moon
flung
her
rays
over
the
whole
heath
but
without
sensibly
lighting
it
except
where
paths
and
water
courses
had
laid
bare
the
white
flints
and
glistening
quartz
sand
which
made
streaks
upon
the
general
shade
after
standing
awhile
he
stooped
and
felt
the
heather
it
was
dry
and
he
flung
himself
down
upon
the
barrow
his
face
towards
the
moon
which
depicted
a
small
image
of
herself
in
each
of
his
eyes
he
had
often
come
up
here
without
stating
his
purpose
to
his
mother
but
this
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
been
ostensibly
frank
as
to
his
purpose
while
really
concealing
it
it
was
a
moral
situation
which
three
months
earlier
he
could
hardly
have
credited
of
himself
in
returning
to
labour
in
this
sequestered
spot
he
had
anticipated
an
escape
from
the
chafing
of
social
necessities
yet
behold
they
were
here
also
more
than
ever
he
longed
to
be
in
some
world
where
personal
ambition
was
not
the
only
recognized
form
of
progress
such
perhaps
as
might
have
been
the
case
at
some
time
or
other
in
the
silvery
globe
then
shining
upon
him
his
eye
travelled
over
the
length
and
breadth
of
that
distant
country
over
the
bay
of
rainbows
the
sombre
sea
of
crises
the
ocean
of
storms
the
lake
of
dreams
the
vast
walled
plains
and
the
wondrous
ring
mountains
till
he
almost
felt
himself
to
be
voyaging
bodily
through
its
wild
scenes
standing
on
its
hollow
hills
traversing
its
deserts
descending
its
vales
and
old
sea
bottoms
or
mounting
to
the
edges
of
its
craters
while
he
watched
the
far
removed
landscape
a
tawny
stain
grew
into
being
on
the
lower
verge
the
eclipse
had
begun
this
marked
a
preconcerted
moment
for
the
remote
celestial
phenomenon
had
been
pressed
into
sublunary
service
as
a
lover
s
signal
yeobright
s
mind
flew
back
to
earth
at
the
sight
he
arose
shook
himself
and
listened
minute
after
minute
passed
by
perhaps
ten
minutes
passed
and
the
shadow
on
the
moon
perceptibly
widened
he
heard
a
rustling
on
his
left
hand
a
cloaked
figure
with
an
upturned
face
appeared
at
the
base
of
the
barrow
and
clym
descended
in
a
moment
the
figure
was
in
his
arms
and
his
lips
upon
hers
my
eustacia
clym
dearest
such
a
situation
had
less
than
three
months
brought
forth
they
remained
long
without
a
single
utterance
for
no
language
could
reach
the
level
of
their
condition
words
were
as
the
rusty
implements
of
a
by
gone
barbarous
epoch
and
only
to
be
occasionally
tolerated
i
began
to
wonder
why
you
did
not
come
said
yeobright
when
she
had
withdrawn
a
little
from
his
embrace
you
said
ten
minutes
after
the
first
mark
of
shade
on
the
edge
of
the
moon
and
that
s
what
it
is
now
well
let
us
only
think
that
here
we
are
then
holding
each
other
s
hand
they
were
again
silent
and
the
shadow
on
the
moon
s
disc
grew
a
little
larger
has
it
seemed
long
since
you
last
saw
me
she
asked
it
has
seemed
sad
and
not
long
that
s
because
you
occupy
yourself
and
so
blind
yourself
to
my
absence
to
me
who
can
do
nothing
it
has
been
like
living
under
stagnant
water
i
would
rather
bear
tediousness
dear
than
have
time
made
short
by
such
means
as
have
shortened
mine
in
what
way
is
that
you
have
been
thinking
you
wished
you
did
not
love
me
how
can
a
man
wish
that
and
yet
love
on
no
eustacia
men
can
women
cannot
well
whatever
i
may
have
thought
one
thing
is
certain
i
do
love
you
past
all
compass
and
description
i
love
you
to
oppressiveness
i
who
have
never
before
felt
more
than
a
pleasant
passing
fancy
for
any
woman
i
have
ever
seen
let
me
look
right
into
your
moonlit
face
and
dwell
on
every
line
and
curve
in
it
only
a
few
hairbreadths
make
the
difference
between
this
face
and
faces
i
have
seen
many
times
before
i
knew
you
yet
what
a
difference
the
difference
between
everything
and
nothing
at
all
one
touch
on
that
mouth
again
there
and
there
and
there
your
eyes
seem
heavy
eustacia
no
it
is
my
general
way
of
looking
i
think
it
arises
from
my
feeling
sometimes
an
agonizing
pity
for
myself
that
i
ever
was
born
you
don
t
feel
it
now
no
yet
i
know
that
we
shall
not
love
like
this
always
nothing
can
ensure
the
continuance
of
love
it
will
evaporate
like
a
spirit
and
so
i
feel
full
of
fears
you
need
not
ah
you
don
t
know
you
have
seen
more
than
i
and
have
been
into
cities
and
among
people
that
i
have
only
heard
of
and
have
lived
more
years
than
i
but
yet
i
am
older
at
this
than
you
i
loved
another
man
once
and
now
i
love
you
in
god
s
mercy
don
t
talk
so
eustacia
but
i
do
not
think
i
shall
be
the
one
who
wearies
first
it
will
i
fear
end
in
this
way
your
mother
will
find
out
that
you
meet
me
and
she
will
influence
you
against
me
that
can
never
be
she
knows
of
these
meetings
already
and
she
speaks
against
me
i
will
not
say
there
go
away
obey
her
i
shall
ruin
you
it
is
foolish
of
you
to
meet
me
like
this
kiss
me
and
go
away
forever
forever
do
you
hear
forever
not
i
it
is
your
only
chance
many
a
man
s
love
has
been
a
curse
to
him
you
are
desperate
full
of
fancies
and
wilful
and
you
misunderstand
i
have
an
additional
reason
for
seeing
you
tonight
besides
love
of
you
for
though
unlike
you
i
feel
our
affection
may
be
eternal
i
feel
with
you
in
this
that
our
present
mode
of
existence
cannot
last
oh
tis
your
mother
yes
that
s
it
i
knew
it
never
mind
what
it
is
believe
this
i
cannot
let
myself
lose
you
i
must
have
you
always
with
me
this
very
evening
i
do
not
like
to
let
you
go
there
is
only
one
cure
for
this
anxiety
dearest
you
must
be
my
wife
she
started
then
endeavoured
to
say
calmly
cynics
say
that
cures
the
anxiety
by
curing
the
love
but
you
must
answer
me
shall
i
claim
you
some
day
i
don
t
mean
at
once
i
must
think
eustacia
murmured
at
present
speak
of
paris
to
me
is
there
any
place
like
it
on
earth
it
is
very
beautiful
but
will
you
be
mine
i
will
be
nobody
else
s
in
the
world
does
that
satisfy
you
yes
for
the
present
now
tell
me
of
the
tuileries
and
the
louvre
she
continued
evasively
i
hate
talking
of
paris
well
i
remember
one
sunny
room
in
the
louvre
which
would
make
a
fitting
place
for
you
to
live
in
the
galerie
d
apollon
its
windows
are
mainly
east
and
in
the
early
morning
when
the
sun
is
bright
the
whole
apartment
is
in
a
perfect
blaze
of
splendour
the
rays
bristle
and
dart
from
the
encrustations
of
gilding
to
the
magnificent
inlaid
coffers
from
the
coffers
to
the
gold
and
silver
plate
from
the
plate
to
the
jewels
and
precious
stones
from
these
to
the
enamels
till
there
is
a
perfect
network
of
light
which
quite
dazzles
the
eye
but
now
about
our
marriage
and
versailles
the
king
s
gallery
is
some
such
gorgeous
room
is
it
not
yes
but
what
s
the
use
of
talking
of
gorgeous
rooms
by
the
way
the
little
trianon
would
suit
us
beautifully
to
live
in
and
you
might
walk
in
the
gardens
in
the
moonlight
and
think
you
were
in
some
english
shrubbery
it
is
laid
out
in
english
fashion
i
should
hate
to
think
that
then
you
could
keep
to
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
grand
palace
all
about
there
you
would
doubtless
feel
in
a
world
of
historical
romance
he
went
on
since
it
was
all
new
to
her
and
described
fontainebleau
st
cloud
the
bois
and
many
other
familiar
haunts
of
the
parisians
till
she
said
when
used
you
to
go
to
these
places
on
sundays
ah
yes
i
dislike
english
sundays
how
i
should
chime
in
with
their
manners
over
there
dear
clym
you
ll
go
back
again
clym
shook
his
head
and
looked
at
the
eclipse
if
you
ll
go
back
again
i
ll
be
something
she
said
tenderly
putting
her
head
near
his
breast
if
you
ll
agree
i
ll
give
my
promise
without
making
you
wait
a
minute
longer
how
extraordinary
that
you
and
my
mother
should
be
of
one
mind
about
this
said
yeobright
i
have
vowed
not
to
go
back
eustacia
it
is
not
the
place
i
dislike
it
is
the
occupation
but
you
can
go
in
some
other
capacity
no
besides
it
would
interfere
with
my
scheme
don
t
press
that
eustacia
will
you
marry
me
i
cannot
tell
now
never
mind
paris
it
is
no
better
than
other
spots
promise
sweet
you
will
never
adhere
to
your
education
plan
i
am
quite
sure
and
then
it
will
be
all
right
for
me
and
so
i
promise
to
be
yours
for
ever
and
ever
clym
brought
her
face
towards
his
by
a
gentle
pressure
of
the
hand
and
kissed
her
ah
but
you
don
t
know
what
you
have
got
in
me
she
said
sometimes
i
think
there
is
not
that
in
eustacia
vye
which
will
make
a
good
homespun
wife
well
let
it
go
see
how
our
time
is
slipping
slipping
slipping
she
pointed
towards
the
half
eclipsed
moon
you
are
too
mournful
no
only
i
dread
to
think
of
anything
beyond
the
present
what
is
we
know
we
are
together
now
and
it
is
unknown
how
long
we
shall
be
so
the
unknown
always
fills
my
mind
with
terrible
possibilities
even
when
i
may
reasonably
expect
it
to
be
cheerful
clym
the
eclipsed
moonlight
shines
upon
your
face
with
a
strange
foreign
colour
and
shows
its
shape
as
if
it
were
cut
out
in
gold
that
means
that
you
should
be
doing
better
things
than
this
you
are
ambitious
eustacia
no
not
exactly
ambitious
luxurious
i
ought
to
be
of
the
same
vein
to
make
you
happy
i
suppose
and
yet
far
from
that
i
could
live
and
die
in
a
hermitage
here
with
proper
work
to
do
there
was
that
in
his
tone
which
implied
distrust
of
his
position
as
a
solicitous
lover
a
doubt
if
he
were
acting
fairly
towards
one
whose
tastes
touched
his
own
only
at
rare
and
infrequent
points
she
saw
his
meaning
and
whispered
in
a
low
full
accent
of
eager
assurance
don
t
mistake
me
clym
though
i
should
like
paris
i
love
you
for
yourself
alone
to
be
your
wife
and
live
in
paris
would
be
heaven
to
me
but
i
would
rather
live
with
you
in
a
hermitage
here
than
not
be
yours
at
all
it
is
gain
to
me
either
way
and
very
great
gain
there
s
my
too
candid
confession
spoken
like
a
woman
and
now
i
must
soon
leave
you
i
ll
walk
with
you
towards
your
house
but
must
you
go
home
yet
she
asked
yes
the
sand
has
nearly
slipped
away
i
see
and
the
eclipse
is
creeping
on
more
and
more
don
t
go
yet
stop
till
the
hour
has
run
itself
out
then
i
will
not
press
you
any
more
you
will
go
home
and
sleep
well
i
keep
sighing
in
my
sleep
do
you
ever
dream
of
me
i
cannot
recollect
a
clear
dream
of
you
i
see
your
face
in
every
scene
of
my
dreams
and
hear
your
voice
in
every
sound
i
wish
i
did
not
it
is
too
much
what
i
feel
they
say
such
love
never
lasts
but
it
must
and
yet
once
i
remember
i
saw
an
officer
of
the
hussars
ride
down
the
street
at
budmouth
and
though
he
was
a
total
stranger
and
never
spoke
to
me
i
loved
him
till
i
thought
i
should
really
die
of
love
but
i
didn
t
die
and
at
last
i
left
off
caring
for
him
how
terrible
it
would
be
if
a
time
should
come
when
i
could
not
love
you
my
clym
please
don
t
say
such
reckless
things
when
we
see
such
a
time
at
hand
we
will
say
i
have
outlived
my
faith
and
purpose
and
die
there
the
hour
has
expired
now
let
us
walk
on
hand
in
hand
they
went
along
the
path
towards
mistover
when
they
were
near
the
house
he
said
it
is
too
late
for
me
to
see
your
grandfather
tonight
do
you
think
he
will
object
to
it
i
will
speak
to
him
i
am
so
accustomed
to
be
my
own
mistress
that
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
we
should
have
to
ask
him
then
they
lingeringly
separated
and
clym
descended
towards
blooms
end
and
as
he
walked
further
and
further
from
the
charmed
atmosphere
of
his
olympian
girl
his
face
grew
sad
with
a
new
sort
of
sadness
a
perception
of
the
dilemma
in
which
his
love
had
placed
him
came
back
in
full
force
in
spite
of
eustacia
s
apparent
willingness
to
wait
through
the
period
of
an
unpromising
engagement
till
he
should
be
established
in
his
new
pursuit
he
could
not
but
perceive
at
moments
that
she
loved
him
rather
as
a
visitant
from
a
gay
world
to
which
she
rightly
belonged
than
as
a
man
with
a
purpose
opposed
to
that
recent
past
of
his
which
so
interested
her
it
meant
that
though
she
made
no
conditions
as
to
his
return
to
the
french
capital
this
was
what
she
secretly
longed
for
in
the
event
of
marriage
and
it
robbed
him
of
many
an
otherwise
pleasant
hour
along
with
that
came
the
widening
breach
between
himself
and
his
mother
whenever
any
little
occurrence
had
brought
into
more
prominence
than
usual
the
disappointment
that
he
was
causing
her
it
had
sent
him
on
lone
and
moody
walks
or
he
was
kept
awake
a
great
part
of
the
night
by
the
turmoil
of
spirit
which
such
a
recognition
created
if
mrs
yeobright
could
only
have
been
led
to
see
what
a
sound
and
worthy
purpose
this
purpose
of
his
was
and
how
little
it
was
being
affected
by
his
devotions
to
eustacia
how
differently
would
she
regard
him
thus
as
his
sight
grew
accustomed
to
the
first
blinding
halo
kindled
about
him
by
love
and
beauty
yeobright
began
to
perceive
what
a
strait
he
was
in
sometimes
he
wished
that
he
had
never
known
eustacia
immediately
to
retract
the
wish
as
brutal
three
antagonistic
growths
had
to
be
kept
alive
his
mother
s
trust
in
him
his
plan
for
becoming
a
teacher
and
eustacia
s
happiness
his
fervid
nature
could
not
afford
to
relinquish
one
of
these
though
two
of
the
three
were
as
many
as
he
could
hope
to
preserve
though
his
love
was
as
chaste
as
that
of
petrarch
for
his
laura
it
had
made
fetters
of
what
previously
was
only
a
difficulty
a
position
which
was
not
too
simple
when
he
stood
whole
hearted
had
become
indescribably
complicated
by
the
addition
of
eustacia
just
when
his
mother
was
beginning
to
tolerate
one
scheme
he
had
introduced
another
still
bitterer
than
the
first
and
the
combination
was
more
than
she
could
bear
sharp
words
are
spoken
and
a
crisis
ensues
when
yeobright
was
not
with
eustacia
he
was
sitting
slavishly
over
his
books
when
he
was
not
reading
he
was
meeting
her
these
meetings
were
carried
on
with
the
greatest
secrecy
one
afternoon
his
mother
came
home
from
a
morning
visit
to
thomasin
he
could
see
from
a
disturbance
in
the
lines
of
her
face
that
something
had
happened
i
have
been
told
an
incomprehensible
thing
she
said
mournfully
the
captain
has
let
out
at
the
woman
that
you
and
eustacia
vye
are
engaged
to
be
married
we
are
said
yeobright
but
it
may
not
be
yet
for
a
very
long
time
i
should
hardly
think
it
would
be
yet
for
a
very
long
time
you
will
take
her
to
paris
i
suppose
she
spoke
with
weary
hopelessness
i
am
not
going
back
to
paris
what
will
you
do
with
a
wife
then
keep
a
school
in
budmouth
as
i
have
told
you
that
s
incredible
the
place
is
overrun
with
schoolmasters
you
have
no
special
qualifications
what
possible
chance
is
there
for
such
as
you
there
is
no
chance
of
getting
rich
but
with
my
system
of
education
which
is
as
new
as
it
is
true
i
shall
do
a
great
deal
of
good
to
my
fellow
creatures
dreams
dreams
if
there
had
been
any
system
left
to
be
invented
they
would
have
found
it
out
at
the
universities
long
before
this
time
never
mother
they
cannot
find
it
out
because
their
teachers
don
t
come
in
contact
with
the
class
which
demands
such
a
system
that
is
those
who
have
had
no
preliminary
training
my
plan
is
one
for
instilling
high
knowledge
into
empty
minds
without
first
cramming
them
with
what
has
to
be
uncrammed
again
before
true
study
begins
i
might
have
believed
you
if
you
had
kept
yourself
free
from
entanglements
but
this
woman
if
she
had
been
a
good
girl
it
would
have
been
bad
enough
but
being
she
is
a
good
girl
so
you
think
a
corfu
bandmaster
s
daughter
what
has
her
life
been
her
surname
even
is
not
her
true
one
she
is
captain
vye
s
granddaughter
and
her
father
merely
took
her
mother
s
name
and
she
is
a
lady
by
instinct
they
call
him
captain
but
anybody
is
captain
he
was
in
the
royal
navy
no
doubt
he
has
been
to
sea
in
some
tub
or
other
why
doesn
t
he
look
after
her
no
lady
would
rove
about
the
heath
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
as
she
does
but
that
s
not
all
of
it
there
was
something
queer
between
her
and
thomasin
s
husband
at
one
time
i
am
as
sure
of
it
as
that
i
stand
here
eustacia
has
told
me
he
did
pay
her
a
little
attention
a
year
ago
but
there
s
no
harm
in
that
i
like
her
all
the
better
clym
said
his
mother
with
firmness
i
have
no
proofs
against
her
unfortunately
but
if
she
makes
you
a
good
wife
there
has
never
been
a
bad
one
believe
me
you
are
almost
exasperating
said
yeobright
vehemently
and
this
very
day
i
had
intended
to
arrange
a
meeting
between
you
but
you
give
me
no
peace
you
try
to
thwart
my
wishes
in
everything
i
hate
the
thought
of
any
son
of
mine
marrying
badly
i
wish
i
had
never
lived
to
see
this
it
is
too
much
for
me
it
is
more
than
i
dreamt
she
turned
to
the
window
her
breath
was
coming
quickly
and
her
lips
were
pale
parted
and
trembling
mother
said
clym
whatever
you
do
you
will
always
be
dear
to
me
that
you
know
but
one
thing
i
have
a
right
to
say
which
is
that
at
my
age
i
am
old
enough
to
know
what
is
best
for
me
mrs
yeobright
remained
for
some
time
silent
and
shaken
as
if
she
could
say
no
more
then
she
replied
best
is
it
best
for
you
to
injure
your
prospects
for
such
a
voluptuous
idle
woman
as
that
don
t
you
see
that
by
the
very
fact
of
your
choosing
her
you
prove
that
you
do
not
know
what
is
best
for
you
you
give
up
your
whole
thought
you
set
your
whole
soul
to
please
a
woman
i
do
and
that
woman
is
you
how
can
you
treat
me
so
flippantly
said
his
mother
turning
again
to
him
with
a
tearful
look
you
are
unnatural
clym
and
i
did
not
expect
it
very
likely
said
he
cheerlessly
you
did
not
know
the
measure
you
were
going
to
mete
me
and
therefore
did
not
know
the
measure
that
would
be
returned
to
you
again
you
answer
me
you
think
only
of
her
you
stick
to
her
in
all
things
that
proves
her
to
be
worthy
i
have
never
yet
supported
what
is
bad
and
i
do
not
care
only
for
her
i
care
for
you
and
for
myself
and
for
anything
that
is
good
when
a
woman
once
dislikes
another
she
is
merciless
o
clym
please
don
t
go
setting
down
as
my
fault
what
is
your
obstinate
wrongheadedness
if
you
wished
to
connect
yourself
with
an
unworthy
person
why
did
you
come
home
here
to
do
it
why
didn
t
you
do
it
in
paris
it
is
more
the
fashion
there
you
have
come
only
to
distress
me
a
lonely
woman
and
shorten
my
days
i
wish
that
you
would
bestow
your
presence
where
you
bestow
your
love
clym
said
huskily
you
are
my
mother
i
will
say
no
more
beyond
this
that
i
beg
your
pardon
for
having
thought
this
my
home
i
will
no
longer
inflict
myself
upon
you
i
ll
go
and
he
went
out
with
tears
in
his
eyes
it
was
a
sunny
afternoon
at
the
beginning
of
summer
and
the
moist
hollows
of
the
heath
had
passed
from
their
brown
to
their
green
stage
yeobright
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
basin
which
extended
down
from
mistover
and
rainbarrow
by
this
time
he
was
calm
and
he
looked
over
the
landscape
in
the
minor
valleys
between
the
hillocks
which
diversified
the
contour
of
the
vale
the
fresh
young
ferns
were
luxuriantly
growing
up
ultimately
to
reach
a
height
of
five
or
six
feet
he
descended
a
little
way
flung
himself
down
in
a
spot
where
a
path
emerged
from
one
of
the
small
hollows
and
waited
hither
it
was
that
he
had
promised
eustacia
to
bring
his
mother
this
afternoon
that
they
might
meet
and
be
friends
his
attempt
had
utterly
failed
he
was
in
a
nest
of
vivid
green
the
ferny
vegetation
round
him
though
so
abundant
was
quite
uniform
it
was
a
grove
of
machine
made
foliage
a
world
of
green
triangles
with
saw
edges
and
not
a
single
flower
the
air
was
warm
with
a
vaporous
warmth
and
the
stillness
was
unbroken
lizards
grasshoppers
and
ants
were
the
only
living
things
to
be
beheld
the
scene
seemed
to
belong
to
the
ancient
world
of
the
carboniferous
period
when
the
forms
of
plants
were
few
and
of
the
fern
kind
when
there
was
neither
bud
nor
blossom
nothing
but
a
monotonous
extent
of
leafage
amid
which
no
bird
sang
when
he
had
reclined
for
some
considerable
time
gloomily
pondering
he
discerned
above
the
ferns
a
drawn
bonnet
of
white
silk
approaching
from
the
left
and
yeobright
knew
directly
that
it
covered
the
head
of
her
he
loved
his
heart
awoke
from
its
apathy
to
a
warm
excitement
and
jumping
to
his
feet
he
said
aloud
i
knew
she
was
sure
to
come
she
vanished
in
a
hollow
for
a
few
moments
and
then
her
whole
form
unfolded
itself
from
the
brake
only
you
here
she
exclaimed
with
a
disappointed
air
whose
hollowness
was
proved
by
her
rising
redness
and
her
half
guilty
low
laugh
where
is
mrs
yeobright
she
has
not
come
he
replied
in
a
subdued
tone
i
wish
i
had
known
that
you
would
be
here
alone
she
said
seriously
and
that
we
were
going
to
have
such
an
idle
pleasant
time
as
this
pleasure
not
known
beforehand
is
half
wasted
to
anticipate
it
is
to
double
it
i
have
not
thought
once
today
of
having
you
all
to
myself
this
afternoon
and
the
actual
moment
of
a
thing
is
so
soon
gone
it
is
indeed
poor
clym
she
continued
looking
tenderly
into
his
face
you
are
sad
something
has
happened
at
your
home
never
mind
what
is
let
us
only
look
at
what
seems
but
darling
what
shall
we
do
said
he
still
go
on
as
we
do
now
just
live
on
from
meeting
to
meeting
never
minding
about
another
day
you
i
know
are
always
thinking
of
that
i
can
see
you
are
but
you
must
not
will
you
dear
clym
you
are
just
like
all
women
they
are
ever
content
to
build
their
lives
on
any
incidental
position
that
offers
itself
whilst
men
would
fain
make
a
globe
to
suit
them
listen
to
this
eustacia
there
is
a
subject
i
have
determined
to
put
off
no
longer
your
sentiment
on
the
wisdom
of
carpe
diem
does
not
impress
me
today
our
present
mode
of
life
must
shortly
be
brought
to
an
end
it
is
your
mother
it
is
i
love
you
none
the
less
in
telling
you
it
is
only
right
you
should
know
i
have
feared
my
bliss
she
said
with
the
merest
motion
of
her
lips
it
has
been
too
intense
and
consuming
there
is
hope
yet
there
are
forty
years
of
work
in
me
yet
and
why
should
you
despair
i
am
only
at
an
awkward
turning
i
wish
people
wouldn
t
be
so
ready
to
think
that
there
is
no
progress
without
uniformity
ah
your
mind
runs
off
to
the
philosophical
side
of
it
well
these
sad
and
hopeless
obstacles
are
welcome
in
one
sense
for
they
enable
us
to
look
with
indifference
upon
the
cruel
satires
that
fate
loves
to
indulge
in
i
have
heard
of
people
who
upon
coming
suddenly
into
happiness
have
died
from
anxiety
lest
they
should
not
live
to
enjoy
it
i
felt
myself
in
that
whimsical
state
of
uneasiness
lately
but
i
shall
be
spared
it
now
let
us
walk
on
clym
took
the
hand
which
was
already
bared
for
him
it
was
a
favourite
way
with
them
to
walk
bare
hand
in
bare
hand
and
led
her
through
the
ferns
they
formed
a
very
comely
picture
of
love
at
full
flush
as
they
walked
along
the
valley
that
late
afternoon
the
sun
sloping
down
on
their
right
and
throwing
their
thin
spectral
shadows
tall
as
poplar
trees
far
out
across
the
furze
and
fern
eustacia
went
with
her
head
thrown
back
fancifully
a
certain
glad
and
voluptuous
air
of
triumph
pervading
her
eyes
at
having
won
by
her
own
unaided
self
a
man
who
was
her
perfect
complement
in
attainment
appearance
and
age
on
the
young
man
s
part
the
paleness
of
face
which
he
had
brought
with
him
from
paris
and
the
incipient
marks
of
time
and
thought
were
less
perceptible
than
when
he
returned
the
healthful
and
energetic
sturdiness
which
was
his
by
nature
having
partially
recovered
its
original
proportions
they
wandered
onward
till
they
reached
the
nether
margin
of
the
heath
where
it
became
marshy
and
merged
in
moorland
i
must
part
from
you
here
clym
said
eustacia
they
stood
still
and
prepared
to
bid
each
other
farewell
everything
before
them
was
on
a
perfect
level
the
sun
resting
on
the
horizon
line
streamed
across
the
ground
from
between
copper
coloured
and
lilac
clouds
stretched
out
in
flats
beneath
a
sky
of
pale
soft
green
all
dark
objects
on
the
earth
that
lay
towards
the
sun
were
overspread
by
a
purple
haze
against
which
groups
of
wailing
gnats
shone
out
rising
upwards
and
dancing
about
like
sparks
of
fire
o
this
leaving
you
is
too
hard
to
bear
exclaimed
eustacia
in
a
sudden
whisper
of
anguish
your
mother
will
influence
you
too
much
i
shall
not
be
judged
fairly
it
will
get
afloat
that
i
am
not
a
good
girl
and
the
witch
story
will
be
added
to
make
me
blacker
they
cannot
nobody
dares
to
speak
disrespectfully
of
you
or
of
me
oh
how
i
wish
i
was
sure
of
never
losing
you
that
you
could
not
be
able
to
desert
me
anyhow
clym
stood
silent
a
moment
his
feelings
were
high
the
moment
was
passionate
and
he
cut
the
knot
you
shall
be
sure
of
me
darling
he
said
folding
her
in
his
arms
we
will
be
married
at
once
o
clym
do
you
agree
to
it
if
if
we
can
we
certainly
can
both
being
of
full
age
and
i
have
not
followed
my
occupation
all
these
years
without
having
accumulated
money
and
if
you
will
agree
to
live
in
a
tiny
cottage
somewhere
on
the
heath
until
i
take
a
house
in
budmouth
for
the
school
we
can
do
it
at
a
very
little
expense
how
long
shall
we
have
to
live
in
the
tiny
cottage
clym
about
six
months
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
shall
have
finished
my
reading
yes
we
will
do
it
and
this
heart
aching
will
be
over
we
shall
of
course
live
in
absolute
seclusion
and
our
married
life
will
only
begin
to
outward
view
when
we
take
the
house
in
budmouth
where
i
have
already
addressed
a
letter
on
the
matter
would
your
grandfather
allow
you
i
think
he
would
on
the
understanding
that
it
should
not
last
longer
than
six
months
i
will
guarantee
that
if
no
misfortune
happens
if
no
misfortune
happens
she
repeated
slowly
which
is
not
likely
dearest
fix
the
exact
day
and
then
they
consulted
on
the
question
and
the
day
was
chosen
it
was
to
be
a
fortnight
from
that
time
this
was
the
end
of
their
talk
and
eustacia
left
him
clym
watched
her
as
she
retired
towards
the
sun
the
luminous
rays
wrapped
her
up
with
her
increasing
distance
and
the
rustle
of
her
dress
over
the
sprouting
sedge
and
grass
died
away
as
he
watched
the
dead
flat
of
the
scenery
overpowered
him
though
he
was
fully
alive
to
the
beauty
of
that
untarnished
early
summer
green
which
was
worn
for
the
nonce
by
the
poorest
blade
there
was
something
in
its
oppressive
horizontality
which
too
much
reminded
him
of
the
arena
of
life
it
gave
him
a
sense
of
bare
equality
with
and
no
superiority
to
a
single
living
thing
under
the
sun
eustacia
was
now
no
longer
the
goddess
but
the
woman
to
him
a
being
to
fight
for
support
help
be
maligned
for
now
that
he
had
reached
a
cooler
moment
he
would
have
preferred
a
less
hasty
marriage
but
the
card
was
laid
and
he
determined
to
abide
by
the
game
whether
eustacia
was
to
add
one
other
to
the
list
of
those
who
love
too
hotly
to
love
long
and
well
the
forthcoming
event
was
certainly
a
ready
way
of
proving
yeobright
goes
and
the
breach
is
complete
all
that
evening
smart
sounds
denoting
an
active
packing
up
came
from
yeobright
s
room
to
the
ears
of
his
mother
downstairs
next
morning
he
departed
from
the
house
and
again
proceeded
across
the
heath
a
long
day
s
march
was
before
him
his
object
being
to
secure
a
dwelling
to
which
he
might
take
eustacia
when
she
became
his
wife
such
a
house
small
secluded
and
with
its
windows
boarded
up
he
had
casually
observed
a
month
earlier
about
two
miles
beyond
the
village
of
east
egdon
and
six
miles
distant
altogether
and
thither
he
directed
his
steps
today
the
weather
was
far
different
from
that
of
the
evening
before
the
yellow
and
vapoury
sunset
which
had
wrapped
up
eustacia
from
his
parting
gaze
had
presaged
change
it
was
one
of
those
not
infrequent
days
of
an
english
june
which
are
as
wet
and
boisterous
as
november
the
cold
clouds
hastened
on
in
a
body
as
if
painted
on
a
moving
slide
vapours
from
other
continents
arrived
upon
the
wind
which
curled
and
parted
round
him
as
he
walked
on
at
length
clym
reached
the
margin
of
a
fir
and
beech
plantation
that
had
been
enclosed
from
heath
land
in
the
year
of
his
birth
here
the
trees
laden
heavily
with
their
new
and
humid
leaves
were
now
suffering
more
damage
than
during
the
highest
winds
of
winter
when
the
boughs
are
especially
disencumbered
to
do
battle
with
the
storm
the
wet
young
beeches
were
undergoing
amputations
bruises
cripplings
and
harsh
lacerations
from
which
the
wasting
sap
would
bleed
for
many
a
day
to
come
and
which
would
leave
scars
visible
till
the
day
of
their
burning
each
stem
was
wrenched
at
the
root
where
it
moved
like
a
bone
in
its
socket
and
at
every
onset
of
the
gale
convulsive
sounds
came
from
the
branches
as
if
pain
were
felt
in
a
neighbouring
brake
a
finch
was
trying
to
sing
but
the
wind
blew
under
his
feathers
till
they
stood
on
end
twisted
round
his
little
tail
and
made
him
give
up
his
song
yet
a
few
yards
to
yeobright
s
left
on
the
open
heath
how
ineffectively
gnashed
the
storm
those
gusts
which
tore
the
trees
merely
waved
the
furze
and
heather
in
a
light
caress
egdon
was
made
for
such
times
as
these
yeobright
reached
the
empty
house
about
midday
it
was
almost
as
lonely
as
that
of
eustacia
s
grandfather
but
the
fact
that
it
stood
near
a
heath
was
disguised
by
a
belt
of
firs
which
almost
enclosed
the
premises
he
journeyed
on
about
a
mile
further
to
the
village
in
which
the
owner
lived
and
returning
with
him
to
the
house
arrangements
were
completed
and
the
man
undertook
that
one
room
at
least
should
be
ready
for
occupation
the
next
day
clym
s
intention
was
to
live
there
alone
until
eustacia
should
join
him
on
their
wedding
day
then
he
turned
to
pursue
his
way
homeward
through
the
drizzle
that
had
so
greatly
transformed
the
scene
the
ferns
among
which
he
had
lain
in
comfort
yesterday
were
dripping
moisture
from
every
frond
wetting
his
legs
through
as
he
brushed
past
and
the
fur
of
the
rabbits
leaping
before
him
was
clotted
into
dark
locks
by
the
same
watery
surrounding
he
reached
home
damp
and
weary
enough
after
his
ten
mile
walk
it
had
hardly
been
a
propitious
beginning
but
he
had
chosen
his
course
and
would
show
no
swerving
the
evening
and
the
following
morning
were
spent
in
concluding
arrangements
for
his
departure
to
stay
at
home
a
minute
longer
than
necessary
after
having
once
come
to
his
determination
would
be
he
felt
only
to
give
new
pain
to
his
mother
by
some
word
look
or
deed
he
had
hired
a
conveyance
and
sent
off
his
goods
by
two
o
clock
that
day
the
next
step
was
to
get
some
furniture
which
after
serving
for
temporary
use
in
the
cottage
would
be
available
for
the
house
at
budmouth
when
increased
by
goods
of
a
better
description
a
mart
extensive
enough
for
the
purpose
existed
at
anglebury
some
miles
beyond
the
spot
chosen
for
his
residence
and
there
he
resolved
to
pass
the
coming
night
it
now
only
remained
to
wish
his
mother
good
bye
she
was
sitting
by
the
window
as
usual
when
he
came
downstairs
mother
i
am
going
to
leave
you
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
i
thought
you
were
by
your
packing
replied
mrs
yeobright
in
a
voice
from
which
every
particle
of
emotion
was
painfully
excluded
and
you
will
part
friends
with
me
certainly
clym
i
am
going
to
be
married
on
the
twenty
fifth
i
thought
you
were
going
to
be
married
and
then
and
then
you
must
come
and
see
us
you
will
understand
me
better
after
that
and
our
situation
will
not
be
so
wretched
as
it
is
now
i
do
not
think
it
likely
i
shall
come
to
see
you
then
it
will
not
be
my
fault
or
eustacia
s
mother
good
bye
he
kissed
her
cheek
and
departed
in
great
misery
which
was
several
hours
in
lessening
itself
to
a
controllable
level
the
position
had
been
such
that
nothing
more
could
be
said
without
in
the
first
place
breaking
down
a
barrier
and
that
was
not
to
be
done
no
sooner
had
yeobright
gone
from
his
mother
s
house
than
her
face
changed
its
rigid
aspect
for
one
of
blank
despair
after
a
while
she
wept
and
her
tears
brought
some
relief
during
the
rest
of
the
day
she
did
nothing
but
walk
up
and
down
the
garden
path
in
a
state
bordering
on
stupefaction
night
came
and
with
it
but
little
rest
the
next
day
with
an
instinct
to
do
something
which
should
reduce
prostration
to
mournfulness
she
went
to
her
son
s
room
and
with
her
own
hands
arranged
it
in
order
for
an
imaginary
time
when
he
should
return
again
she
gave
some
attention
to
her
flowers
but
it
was
perfunctorily
bestowed
for
they
no
longer
charmed
her
it
was
a
great
relief
when
early
in
the
afternoon
thomasin
paid
her
an
unexpected
visit
this
was
not
the
first
meeting
between
the
relatives
since
thomasin
s
marriage
and
past
blunders
having
been
in
a
rough
way
rectified
they
could
always
greet
each
other
with
pleasure
and
ease
the
oblique
band
of
sunlight
which
followed
her
through
the
door
became
the
young
wife
well
it
illuminated
her
as
her
presence
illuminated
the
heath
in
her
movements
in
her
gaze
she
reminded
the
beholder
of
the
feathered
creatures
who
lived
around
her
home
all
similes
and
allegories
concerning
her
began
and
ended
with
birds
there
was
as
much
variety
in
her
motions
as
in
their
flight
when
she
was
musing
she
was
a
kestrel
which
hangs
in
the
air
by
an
invisible
motion
of
its
wings
when
she
was
in
a
high
wind
her
light
body
was
blown
against
trees
and
banks
like
a
heron
s
when
she
was
frightened
she
darted
noiselessly
like
a
kingfisher
when
she
was
serene
she
skimmed
like
a
swallow
and
that
is
how
she
was
moving
now
you
are
looking
very
blithe
upon
my
word
tamsie
said
mrs
yeobright
with
a
sad
smile
how
is
damon
he
is
very
well
is
he
kind
to
you
thomasin
and
mrs
yeobright
observed
her
narrowly
pretty
fairly
is
that
honestly
said
yes
aunt
i
would
tell
you
if
he
were
unkind
she
added
blushing
and
with
hesitation
he
i
don
t
know
if
i
ought
to
complain
to
you
about
this
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
what
to
do
i
want
some
money
you
know
aunt
some
to
buy
little
things
for
myself
and
he
doesn
t
give
me
any
i
don
t
like
to
ask
him
and
yet
perhaps
he
doesn
t
give
it
me
because
he
doesn
t
know
ought
i
to
mention
it
to
him
aunt
of
course
you
ought
have
you
never
said
a
word
on
the
matter
you
see
i
had
some
of
my
own
said
thomasin
evasively
and
i
have
not
wanted
any
of
his
until
lately
i
did
just
say
something
about
it
last
week
but
he
seems
not
to
remember
he
must
be
made
to
remember
you
are
aware
that
i
have
a
little
box
full
of
spade
guineas
which
your
uncle
put
into
my
hands
to
divide
between
yourself
and
clym
whenever
i
chose
perhaps
the
time
has
come
when
it
should
be
done
they
can
be
turned
into
sovereigns
at
any
moment
i
think
i
should
like
to
have
my
share
that
is
if
you
don
t
mind
you
shall
if
necessary
but
it
is
only
proper
that
you
should
first
tell
your
husband
distinctly
that
you
are
without
any
and
see
what
he
will
do
very
well
i
will
aunt
i
have
heard
about
clym
i
know
you
are
in
trouble
about
him
and
that
s
why
i
have
come
mrs
yeobright
turned
away
and
her
features
worked
in
her
attempt
to
conceal
her
feelings
then
she
ceased
to
make
any
attempt
and
said
weeping
o
thomasin
do
you
think
he
hates
me
how
can
he
bear
to
grieve
me
so
when
i
have
lived
only
for
him
through
all
these
years
hate
you
no
said
thomasin
soothingly
it
is
only
that
he
loves
her
too
well
look
at
it
quietly
do
it
is
not
so
very
bad
of
him
do
you
know
i
thought
it
not
the
worst
match
he
could
have
made
miss
vye
s
family
is
a
good
one
on
her
mother
s
side
and
her
father
was
a
romantic
wanderer
a
sort
of
greek
ulysses
it
is
no
use
thomasin
it
is
no
use
your
intention
is
good
but
i
will
not
trouble
you
to
argue
i
have
gone
through
the
whole
that
can
be
said
on
either
side
times
and
many
times
clym
and
i
have
not
parted
in
anger
we
have
parted
in
a
worse
way
it
is
not
a
passionate
quarrel
that
would
have
broken
my
heart
it
is
the
steady
opposition
and
persistence
in
going
wrong
that
he
has
shown
o
thomasin
he
was
so
good
as
a
little
boy
so
tender
and
kind
he
was
i
know
i
did
not
think
one
whom
i
called
mine
would
grow
up
to
treat
me
like
this
he
spoke
to
me
as
if
i
opposed
him
to
injure
him
as
though
i
could
wish
him
ill
there
are
worse
women
in
the
world
than
eustacia
vye
there
are
too
many
better
that
s
the
agony
of
it
it
was
she
thomasin
and
she
only
who
led
your
husband
to
act
as
he
did
i
would
swear
it
no
said
thomasin
eagerly
it
was
before
he
knew
me
that
he
thought
of
her
and
it
was
nothing
but
a
mere
flirtation
very
well
we
will
let
it
be
so
there
is
little
use
in
unravelling
that
now
sons
must
be
blind
if
they
will
why
is
it
that
a
woman
can
see
from
a
distance
what
a
man
cannot
see
close
clym
must
do
as
he
will
he
is
nothing
more
to
me
and
this
is
maternity
to
give
one
s
best
years
and
best
love
to
ensure
the
fate
of
being
despised
you
are
too
unyielding
think
how
many
mothers
there
are
whose
sons
have
brought
them
to
public
shame
by
real
crimes
before
you
feel
so
deeply
a
case
like
this
thomasin
don
t
lecture
me
i
can
t
have
it
it
is
the
excess
above
what
we
expect
that
makes
the
force
of
the
blow
and
that
may
not
be
greater
in
their
case
than
in
mine
they
may
have
foreseen
the
worst
i
am
wrongly
made
thomasin
she
added
with
a
mournful
smile
some
widows
can
guard
against
the
wounds
their
children
give
them
by
turning
their
hearts
to
another
husband
and
beginning
life
again
but
i
always
was
a
poor
weak
one
idea
d
creature
i
had
not
the
compass
of
heart
nor
the
enterprise
for
that
just
as
forlorn
and
stupefied
as
i
was
when
my
husband
s
spirit
flew
away
i
have
sat
ever
since
never
attempting
to
mend
matters
at
all
i
was
comparatively
a
young
woman
then
and
i
might
have
had
another
family
by
this
time
and
have
been
comforted
by
them
for
the
failure
of
this
one
son
it
is
more
noble
in
you
that
you
did
not
the
more
noble
the
less
wise
forget
it
and
be
soothed
dear
aunt
and
i
shall
not
leave
you
alone
for
long
i
shall
come
and
see
you
every
day
and
for
one
week
thomasin
literally
fulfilled
her
word
she
endeavoured
to
make
light
of
the
wedding
and
brought
news
of
the
preparations
and
that
she
was
invited
to
be
present
the
next
week
she
was
rather
unwell
and
did
not
appear
nothing
had
as
yet
been
done
about
the
guineas
for
thomasin
feared
to
address
her
husband
again
on
the
subject
and
mrs
yeobright
had
insisted
upon
this
one
day
just
before
this
time
wildeve
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
quiet
woman
in
addition
to
the
upward
path
through
the
heath
to
rainbarrow
and
mistover
there
was
a
road
which
branched
from
the
highway
a
short
distance
below
the
inn
and
ascended
to
mistover
by
a
circuitous
and
easy
incline
this
was
the
only
route
on
that
side
for
vehicles
to
the
captain
s
retreat
a
light
cart
from
the
nearest
town
descended
the
road
and
the
lad
who
was
driving
pulled
up
in
front
of
the
inn
for
something
to
drink
you
come
from
mistover
said
wildeve
yes
they
are
taking
in
good
things
up
there
going
to
be
a
wedding
and
the
driver
buried
his
face
in
his
mug
wildeve
had
not
received
an
inkling
of
the
fact
before
and
a
sudden
expression
of
pain
overspread
his
face
he
turned
for
a
moment
into
the
passage
to
hide
it
then
he
came
back
again
do
you
mean
miss
vye
he
said
how
is
it
that
she
can
be
married
so
soon
by
the
will
of
god
and
a
ready
young
man
i
suppose
you
don
t
mean
mr
yeobright
yes
he
has
been
creeping
about
with
her
all
the
spring
i
suppose
she
was
immensely
taken
with
him
she
is
crazy
about
him
so
their
general
servant
of
all
work
tells
me
and
that
lad
charley
that
looks
after
the
horse
is
all
in
a
daze
about
it
the
stun
poll
has
got
fond
like
of
her
is
she
lively
is
she
glad
going
to
be
married
so
soon
well
it
isn
t
so
very
soon
no
not
so
very
soon
wildeve
went
indoors
to
the
empty
room
a
curious
heartache
within
him
he
rested
his
elbow
upon
the
mantelpiece
and
his
face
upon
his
hand
when
thomasin
entered
the
room
he
did
not
tell
her
of
what
he
had
heard
the
old
longing
for
eustacia
had
reappeared
in
his
soul
and
it
was
mainly
because
he
had
discovered
that
it
was
another
man
s
intention
to
possess
her
to
be
yearning
for
the
difficult
to
be
weary
of
that
offered
to
care
for
the
remote
to
dislike
the
near
it
was
wildeve
s
nature
always
this
is
the
true
mark
of
the
man
of
sentiment
though
wildeve
s
fevered
feeling
had
not
been
elaborated
to
real
poetical
compass
it
was
of
the
standard
sort
his
might
have
been
called
the
rousseau
of
egdon
the
morning
and
the
evening
of
a
day
the
wedding
morning
came
nobody
would
have
imagined
from
appearances
that
blooms
end
had
any
interest
in
mistover
that
day
a
solemn
stillness
prevailed
around
the
house
of
clym
s
mother
and
there
was
no
more
animation
indoors
mrs
yeobright
who
had
declined
to
attend
the
ceremony
sat
by
the
breakfast
table
in
the
old
room
which
communicated
immediately
with
the
porch
her
eyes
listlessly
directed
towards
the
open
door
it
was
the
room
in
which
six
months
earlier
the
merry
christmas
party
had
met
to
which
eustacia
came
secretly
and
as
a
stranger
the
only
living
thing
that
entered
now
was
a
sparrow
and
seeing
no
movements
to
cause
alarm
he
hopped
boldly
round
the
room
endeavoured
to
go
out
by
the
window
and
fluttered
among
the
pot
flowers
this
roused
the
lonely
sitter
who
got
up
released
the
bird
and
went
to
the
door
she
was
expecting
thomasin
who
had
written
the
night
before
to
state
that
the
time
had
come
when
she
would
wish
to
have
the
money
and
that
she
would
if
possible
call
this
day
yet
thomasin
occupied
mrs
yeobright
s
thoughts
but
slightly
as
she
looked
up
the
valley
of
the
heath
alive
with
butterflies
and
with
grasshoppers
whose
husky
noises
on
every
side
formed
a
whispered
chorus
a
domestic
drama
for
which
the
preparations
were
now
being
made
a
mile
or
two
off
was
but
little
less
vividly
present
to
her
eyes
than
if
enacted
before
her
she
tried
to
dismiss
the
vision
and
walked
about
the
garden
plot
but
her
eyes
ever
and
anon
sought
out
the
direction
of
the
parish
church
to
which
mistover
belonged
and
her
excited
fancy
clove
the
hills
which
divided
the
building
from
her
eyes
the
morning
wore
away
eleven
o
clock
struck
could
it
be
that
the
wedding
was
then
in
progress
it
must
be
so
she
went
on
imagining
the
scene
at
the
church
which
he
had
by
this
time
approached
with
his
bride
she
pictured
the
little
group
of
children
by
the
gate
as
the
pony
carriage
drove
up
in
which
as
thomasin
had
learnt
they
were
going
to
perform
the
short
journey
then
she
saw
them
enter
and
proceed
to
the
chancel
and
kneel
and
the
service
seemed
to
go
on
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
o
it
is
a
mistake
she
groaned
and
he
will
rue
it
some
day
and
think
of
me
while
she
remained
thus
overcome
by
her
forebodings
the
old
clock
indoors
whizzed
forth
twelve
strokes
soon
after
faint
sounds
floated
to
her
ear
from
afar
over
the
hills
the
breeze
came
from
that
quarter
and
it
had
brought
with
it
the
notes
of
distant
bells
gaily
starting
off
in
a
peal
one
two
three
four
five
the
ringers
at
east
egdon
were
announcing
the
nuptials
of
eustacia
and
her
son
then
it
is
over
she
murmured
well
well
and
life
too
will
be
over
soon
and
why
should
i
go
on
scalding
my
face
like
this
cry
about
one
thing
in
life
cry
about
all
one
thread
runs
through
the
whole
piece
and
yet
we
say
a
time
to
laugh
towards
evening
wildeve
came
since
thomasin
s
marriage
mrs
yeobright
had
shown
him
that
grim
friendliness
which
at
last
arises
in
all
such
cases
of
undesired
affinity
the
vision
of
what
ought
to
have
been
is
thrown
aside
in
sheer
weariness
and
browbeaten
human
endeavour
listlessly
makes
the
best
of
the
fact
that
is
wildeve
to
do
him
justice
had
behaved
very
courteously
to
his
wife
s
aunt
and
it
was
with
no
surprise
that
she
saw
him
enter
now
thomasin
has
not
been
able
to
come
as
she
promised
to
do
he
replied
to
her
inquiry
which
had
been
anxious
for
she
knew
that
her
niece
was
badly
in
want
of
money
the
captain
came
down
last
night
and
personally
pressed
her
to
join
them
today
so
not
to
be
unpleasant
she
determined
to
go
they
fetched
her
in
the
pony
chaise
and
are
going
to
bring
her
back
then
it
is
done
said
mrs
yeobright
have
they
gone
to
their
new
home
i
don
t
know
i
have
had
no
news
from
mistover
since
thomasin
left
to
go
you
did
not
go
with
her
said
she
as
if
there
might
be
good
reasons
why
i
could
not
said
wildeve
reddening
slightly
we
could
not
both
leave
the
house
it
was
rather
a
busy
morning
on
account
of
anglebury
great
market
i
believe
you
have
something
to
give
to
thomasin
if
you
like
i
will
take
it
mrs
yeobright
hesitated
and
wondered
if
wildeve
knew
what
the
something
was
did
she
tell
you
of
this
she
inquired
not
particularly
she
casually
dropped
a
remark
about
having
arranged
to
fetch
some
article
or
other
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
send
it
she
can
have
it
whenever
she
chooses
to
come
that
won
t
be
yet
in
the
present
state
of
her
health
she
must
not
go
on
walking
so
much
as
she
has
done
he
added
with
a
faint
twang
of
sarcasm
what
wonderful
thing
is
it
that
i
cannot
be
trusted
to
take
nothing
worth
troubling
you
with
one
would
think
you
doubted
my
honesty
he
said
with
a
laugh
though
his
colour
rose
in
a
quick
resentfulness
frequent
with
him
you
need
think
no
such
thing
said
she
drily
it
is
simply
that
i
in
common
with
the
rest
of
the
world
feel
that
there
are
certain
things
which
had
better
be
done
by
certain
people
than
by
others
as
you
like
as
you
like
said
wildeve
laconically
it
is
not
worth
arguing
about
well
i
think
i
must
turn
homeward
again
as
the
inn
must
not
be
left
long
in
charge
of
the
lad
and
the
maid
only
he
went
his
way
his
farewell
being
scarcely
so
courteous
as
his
greeting
but
mrs
yeobright
knew
him
thoroughly
by
this
time
and
took
little
notice
of
his
manner
good
or
bad
when
wildeve
was
gone
mrs
yeobright
stood
and
considered
what
would
be
the
best
course
to
adopt
with
regard
to
the
guineas
which
she
had
not
liked
to
entrust
to
wildeve
it
was
hardly
credible
that
thomasin
had
told
him
to
ask
for
them
when
the
necessity
for
them
had
arisen
from
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
money
at
his
hands
at
the
same
time
thomasin
really
wanted
them
and
might
be
unable
to
come
to
blooms
end
for
another
week
at
least
to
take
or
send
the
money
to
her
at
the
inn
would
be
impolite
since
wildeve
would
pretty
surely
be
present
or
would
discover
the
transaction
and
if
as
her
aunt
suspected
he
treated
her
less
kindly
than
she
deserved
to
be
treated
he
might
then
get
the
whole
sum
out
of
her
gentle
hands
but
on
this
particular
evening
thomasin
was
at
mistover
and
anything
might
be
conveyed
to
her
there
without
the
knowledge
of
her
husband
upon
the
whole
the
opportunity
was
worth
taking
advantage
of
her
son
too
was
there
and
was
now
married
there
could
be
no
more
proper
moment
to
render
him
his
share
of
the
money
than
the
present
and
the
chance
that
would
be
afforded
her
by
sending
him
this
gift
of
showing
how
far
she
was
from
bearing
him
ill
will
cheered
the
sad
mother
s
heart
she
went
upstairs
and
took
from
a
locked
drawer
a
little
box
out
of
which
she
poured
a
hoard
of
broad
unworn
guineas
that
had
lain
there
many
a
year
there
were
a
hundred
in
all
and
she
divided
them
into
two
heaps
fifty
in
each
tying
up
these
in
small
canvas
bags
she
went
down
to
the
garden
and
called
to
christian
cantle
who
was
loitering
about
in
hope
of
a
supper
which
was
not
really
owed
him
mrs
yeobright
gave
him
the
moneybags
charged
him
to
go
to
mistover
and
on
no
account
to
deliver
them
into
any
one
s
hands
save
her
son
s
and
thomasin
s
on
further
thought
she
deemed
it
advisable
to
tell
christian
precisely
what
the
two
bags
contained
that
he
might
be
fully
impressed
with
their
importance
christian
pocketed
the
moneybags
promised
the
greatest
carefulness
and
set
out
on
his
way
you
need
not
hurry
said
mrs
yeobright
it
will
be
better
not
to
get
there
till
after
dusk
and
then
nobody
will
notice
you
come
back
here
to
supper
if
it
is
not
too
late
it
was
nearly
nine
o
clock
when
he
began
to
ascend
the
vale
towards
mistover
but
the
long
days
of
summer
being
at
their
climax
the
first
obscurity
of
evening
had
only
just
begun
to
tan
the
landscape
at
this
point
of
his
journey
christian
heard
voices
and
found
that
they
proceeded
from
a
company
of
men
and
women
who
were
traversing
a
hollow
ahead
of
him
the
tops
only
of
their
heads
being
visible
he
paused
and
thought
of
the
money
he
carried
it
was
almost
too
early
even
for
christian
seriously
to
fear
robbery
nevertheless
he
took
a
precaution
which
ever
since
his
boyhood
he
had
adopted
whenever
he
carried
more
than
two
or
three
shillings
upon
his
person
a
precaution
somewhat
like
that
of
the
owner
of
the
pitt
diamond
when
filled
with
similar
misgivings
he
took
off
his
boots
untied
the
guineas
and
emptied
the
contents
of
one
little
bag
into
the
right
boot
and
of
the
other
into
the
left
spreading
them
as
flatly
as
possible
over
the
bottom
of
each
which
was
really
a
spacious
coffer
by
no
means
limited
to
the
size
of
the
foot
pulling
them
on
again
and
lacing
them
to
the
very
top
he
proceeded
on
his
way
more
easy
in
his
head
than
under
his
soles
his
path
converged
towards
that
of
the
noisy
company
and
on
coming
nearer
he
found
to
his
relief
that
they
were
several
egdon
people
whom
he
knew
very
well
while
with
them
walked
fairway
of
blooms
end
what
christian
going
too
said
fairway
as
soon
as
he
recognized
the
newcomer
you
ve
got
no
young
woman
nor
wife
to
your
name
to
gie
a
gown
piece
to
i
m
sure
what
d
ye
mean
said
christian
why
the
raffle
the
one
we
go
to
every
year
going
to
the
raffle
as
well
as
ourselves
never
knew
a
word
o
t
is
it
like
cudgel
playing
or
other
sportful
forms
of
bloodshed
i
don
t
want
to
go
thank
you
mister
fairway
and
no
offence
christian
don
t
know
the
fun
o
t
and
twould
be
a
fine
sight
for
him
said
a
buxom
woman
there
s
no
danger
at
all
christian
every
man
puts
in
a
shilling
apiece
and
one
wins
a
gown
piece
for
his
wife
or
sweetheart
if
he
s
got
one
well
as
that
s
not
my
fortune
there
s
no
meaning
in
it
to
me
but
i
should
like
to
see
the
fun
if
there
s
nothing
of
the
black
art
in
it
and
if
a
man
may
look
on
without
cost
or
getting
into
any
dangerous
wrangle
there
will
be
no
uproar
at
all
said
timothy
sure
christian
if
you
d
like
to
come
we
ll
see
there
s
no
harm
done
and
no
ba
dy
gaieties
i
suppose
you
see
neighbours
if
so
it
would
be
setting
father
a
bad
example
as
he
is
so
light
moral
d
but
a
gown
piece
for
a
shilling
and
no
black
art
tis
worth
looking
in
to
see
and
it
wouldn
t
hinder
me
half
an
hour
yes
i
ll
come
if
you
ll
step
a
little
way
towards
mistover
with
me
afterwards
supposing
night
should
have
closed
in
and
nobody
else
is
going
that
way
one
or
two
promised
and
christian
diverging
from
his
direct
path
turned
round
to
the
right
with
his
companions
towards
the
quiet
woman
when
they
entered
the
large
common
room
of
the
inn
they
found
assembled
there
about
ten
men
from
among
the
neighbouring
population
and
the
group
was
increased
by
the
new
contingent
to
double
that
number
most
of
them
were
sitting
round
the
room
in
seats
divided
by
wooden
elbows
like
those
of
crude
cathedral
stalls
which
were
carved
with
the
initials
of
many
an
illustrious
drunkard
of
former
times
who
had
passed
his
days
and
his
nights
between
them
and
now
lay
as
an
alcoholic
cinder
in
the
nearest
churchyard
among
the
cups
on
the
long
table
before
the
sitters
lay
an
open
parcel
of
light
drapery
the
gown
piece
as
it
was
called
which
was
to
be
raffled
for
wildeve
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fireplace
smoking
a
cigar
and
the
promoter
of
the
raffle
a
packman
from
a
distant
town
was
expatiating
upon
the
value
of
the
fabric
as
material
for
a
summer
dress
now
gentlemen
he
continued
as
the
newcomers
drew
up
to
the
table
there
s
five
have
entered
and
we
want
four
more
to
make
up
the
number
i
think
by
the
faces
of
those
gentlemen
who
have
just
come
in
that
they
are
shrewd
enough
to
take
advantage
of
this
rare
opportunity
of
beautifying
their
ladies
at
a
very
trifling
expense
fairway
sam
and
another
placed
their
shillings
on
the
table
and
the
man
turned
to
christian
no
sir
said
christian
drawing
back
with
a
quick
gaze
of
misgiving
i
am
only
a
poor
chap
come
to
look
on
an
it
please
ye
sir
i
don
t
so
much
as
know
how
you
do
it
if
so
be
i
was
sure
of
getting
it
i
would
put
down
the
shilling
but
i
couldn
t
otherwise
i
think
you
might
almost
be
sure
said
the
pedlar
in
fact
now
i
look
into
your
face
even
if
i
can
t
say
you
are
sure
to
win
i
can
say
that
i
never
saw
anything
look
more
like
winning
in
my
life
you
ll
anyhow
have
the
same
chance
as
the
rest
of
us
said
sam
and
the
extra
luck
of
being
the
last
comer
said
another
and
i
was
born
wi
a
caul
and
perhaps
can
be
no
more
ruined
than
drowned
christian
added
beginning
to
give
way
ultimately
christian
laid
down
his
shilling
the
raffle
began
and
the
dice
went
round
when
it
came
to
christian
s
turn
he
took
the
box
with
a
trembling
hand
shook
it
fearfully
and
threw
a
pair
royal
three
of
the
others
had
thrown
common
low
pairs
and
all
the
rest
mere
points
the
gentleman
looked
like
winning
as
i
said
observed
the
chapman
blandly
take
it
sir
the
article
is
yours
haw
haw
haw
said
fairway
i
m
damned
if
this
isn
t
the
quarest
start
that
ever
i
knowed
mine
asked
christian
with
a
vacant
stare
from
his
target
eyes
i
i
haven
t
got
neither
maid
wife
nor
widder
belonging
to
me
at
all
and
i
m
afeard
it
will
make
me
laughed
at
to
ha
e
it
master
traveller
what
with
being
curious
to
join
in
i
never
thought
of
that
what
shall
i
do
wi
a
woman
s
clothes
in
my
bedroom
and
not
lose
my
decency
keep
em
to
be
sure
said
fairway
if
it
is
only
for
luck
perhaps
twill
tempt
some
woman
that
thy
poor
carcase
had
no
power
over
when
standing
empty
handed
keep
it
certainly
said
wildeve
who
had
idly
watched
the
scene
from
a
distance
the
table
was
then
cleared
of
the
articles
and
the
men
began
to
drink
well
to
be
sure
said
christian
half
to
himself
to
think
i
should
have
been
born
so
lucky
as
this
and
not
have
found
it
out
until
now
what
curious
creatures
these
dice
be
powerful
rulers
of
us
all
and
yet
at
my
command
i
am
sure
i
never
need
be
afeared
of
anything
after
this
he
handled
the
dice
fondly
one
by
one
why
sir
he
said
in
a
confidential
whisper
to
wildeve
who
was
near
his
left
hand
if
i
could
only
use
this
power
that
s
in
me
of
multiplying
money
i
might
do
some
good
to
a
near
relation
of
yours
seeing
what
i
ve
got
about
me
of
hers
eh
he
tapped
one
of
his
money
laden
boots
upon
the
floor
what
do
you
mean
said
wildeve
that
s
a
secret
well
i
must
be
going
now
he
looked
anxiously
towards
fairway
where
are
you
going
wildeve
asked
to
mistover
knap
i
have
to
see
mrs
thomasin
there
that
s
all
i
am
going
there
too
to
fetch
mrs
wildeve
we
can
walk
together
wildeve
became
lost
in
thought
and
a
look
of
inward
illumination
came
into
his
eyes
it
was
money
for
his
wife
that
mrs
yeobright
could
not
trust
him
with
yet
she
could
trust
this
fellow
he
said
to
himself
why
doesn
t
that
which
belongs
to
the
wife
belong
to
the
husband
too
he
called
to
the
pot
boy
to
bring
him
his
hat
and
said
now
christian
i
am
ready
mr
wildeve
said
christian
timidly
as
he
turned
to
leave
the
room
would
you
mind
lending
me
them
wonderful
little
things
that
carry
my
luck
inside
em
that
i
might
practise
a
bit
by
myself
you
know
he
looked
wistfully
at
the
dice
and
box
lying
on
the
mantlepiece
certainly
said
wildeve
carelessly
they
were
only
cut
out
by
some
lad
with
his
knife
and
are
worth
nothing
and
christian
went
back
and
privately
pocketed
them
wildeve
opened
the
door
and
looked
out
the
night
was
warm
and
cloudy
by
gad
tis
dark
he
continued
but
i
suppose
we
shall
find
our
way
if
we
should
lose
the
path
it
might
be
awkward
said
christian
a
lantern
is
the
only
shield
that
will
make
it
safe
for
us
let
s
have
a
lantern
by
all
means
the
stable
lantern
was
fetched
and
lighted
christian
took
up
his
gownpiece
and
the
two
set
out
to
ascend
the
hill
within
the
room
the
men
fell
into
chat
till
their
attention
was
for
a
moment
drawn
to
the
chimney
corner
this
was
large
and
in
addition
to
its
proper
recess
contained
within
its
jambs
like
many
on
egdon
a
receding
seat
so
that
a
person
might
sit
there
absolutely
unobserved
provided
there
was
no
fire
to
light
him
up
as
was
the
case
now
and
throughout
the
summer
from
the
niche
a
single
object
protruded
into
the
light
from
the
candles
on
the
table
it
was
a
clay
pipe
and
its
colour
was
reddish
the
men
had
been
attracted
to
this
object
by
a
voice
behind
the
pipe
asking
for
a
light
upon
my
life
it
fairly
startled
me
when
the
man
spoke
said
fairway
handing
a
candle
oh
tis
the
reddleman
you
ve
kept
a
quiet
tongue
young
man
yes
i
had
nothing
to
say
observed
venn
in
a
few
minutes
he
arose
and
wished
the
company
good
night
meanwhile
wildeve
and
christian
had
plunged
into
the
heath
it
was
a
stagnant
warm
and
misty
night
full
of
all
the
heavy
perfumes
of
new
vegetation
not
yet
dried
by
hot
sun
and
among
these
particularly
the
scent
of
the
fern
the
lantern
dangling
from
christian
s
hand
brushed
the
feathery
fronds
in
passing
by
disturbing
moths
and
other
winged
insects
which
flew
out
and
alighted
upon
its
horny
panes
so
you
have
money
to
carry
to
mrs
wildeve
said
christian
s
companion
after
a
silence
don
t
you
think
it
very
odd
that
it
shouldn
t
be
given
to
me
as
man
and
wife
be
one
flesh
twould
have
been
all
the
same
i
should
think
said
christian
but
my
strict
documents
was
to
give
the
money
into
mrs
wildeve
s
hand
and
tis
well
to
do
things
right
no
doubt
said
wildeve
any
person
who
had
known
the
circumstances
might
have
perceived
that
wildeve
was
mortified
by
the
discovery
that
the
matter
in
transit
was
money
and
not
as
he
had
supposed
when
at
blooms
end
some
fancy
nick
nack
which
only
interested
the
two
women
themselves
mrs
yeobright
s
refusal
implied
that
his
honour
was
not
considered
to
be
of
sufficiently
good
quality
to
make
him
a
safer
bearer
of
his
wife
s
property
how
very
warm
it
is
tonight
christian
he
said
panting
when
they
were
nearly
under
rainbarrow
let
us
sit
down
for
a
few
minutes
for
heaven
s
sake
wildeve
flung
himself
down
on
the
soft
ferns
and
christian
placing
the
lantern
and
parcel
on
the
ground
perched
himself
in
a
cramped
position
hard
by
his
knees
almost
touching
his
chin
he
presently
thrust
one
hand
into
his
coat
pocket
and
began
shaking
it
about
what
are
you
rattling
in
there
said
wildeve
only
the
dice
sir
said
christian
quickly
withdrawing
his
hand
what
magical
machines
these
little
things
be
mr
wildeve
tis
a
game
i
should
never
get
tired
of
would
you
mind
my
taking
em
out
and
looking
at
em
for
a
minute
to
see
how
they
are
made
i
didn
t
like
to
look
close
before
the
other
men
for
fear
they
should
think
it
bad
manners
in
me
christian
took
them
out
and
examined
them
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
by
the
lantern
light
that
these
little
things
should
carry
such
luck
and
such
charm
and
such
a
spell
and
such
power
in
em
passes
all
i
ever
heard
or
zeed
he
went
on
with
a
fascinated
gaze
at
the
dice
which
as
is
frequently
the
case
in
country
places
were
made
of
wood
the
points
being
burnt
upon
each
face
with
the
end
of
a
wire
they
are
a
great
deal
in
a
small
compass
you
think
yes
do
ye
suppose
they
really
be
the
devil
s
playthings
mr
wildeve
if
so
tis
no
good
sign
that
i
be
such
a
lucky
man
you
ought
to
win
some
money
now
that
you
ve
got
them
any
woman
would
marry
you
then
now
is
your
time
christian
and
i
would
recommend
you
not
to
let
it
slip
some
men
are
born
to
luck
some
are
not
i
belong
to
the
latter
class
did
you
ever
know
anybody
who
was
born
to
it
besides
myself
o
yes
i
once
heard
of
an
italian
who
sat
down
at
a
gaming
table
with
only
a
louis
that
s
a
foreign
sovereign
in
his
pocket
he
played
on
for
twenty
four
hours
and
won
ten
thousand
pounds
stripping
the
bank
he
had
played
against
then
there
was
another
man
who
had
lost
a
thousand
pounds
and
went
to
the
broker
s
next
day
to
sell
stock
that
he
might
pay
the
debt
the
man
to
whom
he
owed
the
money
went
with
him
in
a
hackney
coach
and
to
pass
the
time
they
tossed
who
should
pay
the
fare
the
ruined
man
won
and
the
other
was
tempted
to
continue
the
game
and
they
played
all
the
way
when
the
coachman
stopped
he
was
told
to
drive
home
again
the
whole
thousand
pounds
had
been
won
back
by
the
man
who
was
going
to
sell
ha
ha
splendid
exclaimed
christian
go
on
go
on
then
there
was
a
man
of
london
who
was
only
a
waiter
at
white
s
clubhouse
he
began
playing
first
half
crown
stakes
and
then
higher
and
higher
till
he
became
very
rich
got
an
appointment
in
india
and
rose
to
be
governor
of
madras
his
daughter
married
a
member
of
parliament
and
the
bishop
of
carlisle
stood
godfather
to
one
of
the
children
wonderful
wonderful
and
once
there
was
a
young
man
in
america
who
gambled
till
he
had
lost
his
last
dollar
he
staked
his
watch
and
chain
and
lost
as
before
staked
his
umbrella
lost
again
staked
his
hat
lost
again
staked
his
coat
and
stood
in
his
shirt
sleeves
lost
again
began
taking
off
his
breeches
and
then
a
looker
on
gave
him
a
trifle
for
his
pluck
with
this
he
won
won
back
his
coat
won
back
his
hat
won
back
his
umbrella
his
watch
his
money
and
went
out
of
the
door
a
rich
man
oh
tis
too
good
it
takes
away
my
breath
mr
wildeve
i
think
i
will
try
another
shilling
with
you
as
i
am
one
of
that
sort
no
danger
can
come
o
t
and
you
can
afford
to
lose
very
well
said
wildeve
rising
searching
about
with
the
lantern
he
found
a
large
flat
stone
which
he
placed
between
himself
and
christian
and
sat
down
again
the
lantern
was
opened
to
give
more
light
and
it
s
rays
directed
upon
the
stone
christian
put
down
a
shilling
wildeve
another
and
each
threw
christian
won
they
played
for
two
christian
won
again
let
us
try
four
said
wildeve
they
played
for
four
this
time
the
stakes
were
won
by
wildeve
ah
those
little
accidents
will
of
course
sometimes
happen
to
the
luckiest
man
he
observed
and
now
i
have
no
more
money
explained
christian
excitedly
and
yet
if
i
could
go
on
i
should
get
it
back
again
and
more
i
wish
this
was
mine
he
struck
his
boot
upon
the
ground
so
that
the
guineas
chinked
within
what
you
have
not
put
mrs
wildeve
s
money
there
yes
tis
for
safety
is
it
any
harm
to
raffle
with
a
married
lady
s
money
when
if
i
win
i
shall
only
keep
my
winnings
and
give
her
her
own
all
the
same
and
if
t
other
man
wins
her
money
will
go
to
the
lawful
owner
none
at
all
wildeve
had
been
brooding
ever
since
they
started
on
the
mean
estimation
in
which
he
was
held
by
his
wife
s
friends
and
it
cut
his
heart
severely
as
the
minutes
passed
he
had
gradually
drifted
into
a
revengeful
intention
without
knowing
the
precise
moment
of
forming
it
this
was
to
teach
mrs
yeobright
a
lesson
as
he
considered
it
to
be
in
other
words
to
show
her
if
he
could
that
her
niece
s
husband
was
the
proper
guardian
of
her
niece
s
money
well
here
goes
said
christian
beginning
to
unlace
one
boot
i
shall
dream
of
it
nights
and
nights
i
suppose
but
i
shall
always
swear
my
flesh
don
t
crawl
when
i
think
o
t
he
thrust
his
hand
into
the
boot
and
withdrew
one
of
poor
thomasin
s
precious
guineas
piping
hot
wildeve
had
already
placed
a
sovereign
on
the
stone
the
game
was
then
resumed
wildeve
won
first
and
christian
ventured
another
winning
himself
this
time
the
game
fluctuated
but
the
average
was
in
wildeve
s
favour
both
men
became
so
absorbed
in
the
game
that
they
took
no
heed
of
anything
but
the
pigmy
objects
immediately
beneath
their
eyes
the
flat
stone
the
open
lantern
the
dice
and
the
few
illuminated
fern
leaves
which
lay
under
the
light
were
the
whole
world
to
them
at
length
christian
lost
rapidly
and
presently
to
his
horror
the
whole
fifty
guineas
belonging
to
thomasin
had
been
handed
over
to
his
adversary
i
don
t
care
i
don
t
care
he
moaned
and
desperately
set
about
untying
his
left
boot
to
get
at
the
other
fifty
the
devil
will
toss
me
into
the
flames
on
his
three
pronged
fork
for
this
night
s
work
i
know
but
perhaps
i
shall
win
yet
and
then
i
ll
get
a
wife
to
sit
up
with
me
o
nights
and
i
won
t
be
afeard
i
won
t
here
s
another
for
ee
my
man
he
slapped
another
guinea
down
upon
the
stone
and
the
dice
box
was
rattled
again
time
passed
on
wildeve
began
to
be
as
excited
as
christian
himself
when
commencing
the
game
his
intention
had
been
nothing
further
than
a
bitter
practical
joke
on
mrs
yeobright
to
win
the
money
fairly
or
otherwise
and
to
hand
it
contemptuously
to
thomasin
in
her
aunt
s
presence
had
been
the
dim
outline
of
his
purpose
but
men
are
drawn
from
their
intentions
even
in
the
course
of
carrying
them
out
and
it
was
extremely
doubtful
by
the
time
the
twentieth
guinea
had
been
reached
whether
wildeve
was
conscious
of
any
other
intention
than
that
of
winning
for
his
own
personal
benefit
moreover
he
was
now
no
longer
gambling
for
his
wife
s
money
but
for
yeobright
s
though
of
this
fact
christian
in
his
apprehensiveness
did
not
inform
him
till
afterwards
it
was
nearly
eleven
o
clock
when
with
almost
a
shriek
christian
placed
yeobright
s
last
gleaming
guinea
upon
the
stone
in
thirty
seconds
it
had
gone
the
way
of
its
companions
christian
turned
and
flung
himself
on
the
ferns
in
a
convulsion
of
remorse
o
what
shall
i
do
with
my
wretched
self
he
groaned
what
shall
i
do
will
any
good
heaven
hae
mercy
upon
my
wicked
soul
do
live
on
just
the
same
i
won
t
live
on
just
the
same
i
ll
die
i
say
you
are
a
a
a
man
sharper
than
my
neighbour
yes
a
man
sharper
than
my
neighbour
a
regular
sharper
poor
chips
in
porridge
you
are
very
unmannerly
i
don
t
know
about
that
and
i
say
you
be
unmannerly
you
ve
got
money
that
isn
t
your
own
half
the
guineas
are
poor
mr
clym
s
how
s
that
because
i
had
to
gie
fifty
of
em
to
him
mrs
yeobright
said
so
oh
well
twould
have
been
more
graceful
of
her
to
have
given
them
to
his
wife
eustacia
but
they
are
in
my
hands
now
christian
pulled
on
his
boots
and
with
heavy
breathings
which
could
be
heard
to
some
distance
dragged
his
limbs
together
arose
and
tottered
away
out
of
sight
wildeve
set
about
shutting
the
lantern
to
return
to
the
house
for
he
deemed
it
too
late
to
go
to
mistover
to
meet
his
wife
who
was
to
be
driven
home
in
the
captain
s
four
wheel
while
he
was
closing
the
little
horn
door
a
figure
rose
from
behind
a
neighbouring
bush
and
came
forward
into
the
lantern
light
it
was
the
reddleman
approaching
a
new
force
disturbs
the
current
wildeve
stared
venn
looked
coolly
towards
wildeve
and
without
a
word
being
spoken
he
deliberately
sat
himself
down
where
christian
had
been
seated
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
drew
out
a
sovereign
and
laid
it
on
the
stone
you
have
been
watching
us
from
behind
that
bush
said
wildeve
the
reddleman
nodded
down
with
your
stake
he
said
or
haven
t
you
pluck
enough
to
go
on
now
gambling
is
a
species
of
amusement
which
is
much
more
easily
begun
with
full
pockets
than
left
off
with
the
same
and
though
wildeve
in
a
cooler
temper
might
have
prudently
declined
this
invitation
the
excitement
of
his
recent
success
carried
him
completely
away
he
placed
one
of
the
guineas
on
a
slab
beside
the
reddleman
s
sovereign
mine
is
a
guinea
he
said
a
guinea
that
s
not
your
own
said
venn
sarcastically
it
is
my
own
answered
wildeve
haughtily
it
is
my
wife
s
and
what
is
hers
is
mine
very
well
let
s
make
a
beginning
he
shook
the
box
and
threw
eight
ten
and
nine
the
three
casts
amounted
to
twenty
seven
this
encouraged
wildeve
he
took
the
box
and
his
three
casts
amounted
to
forty
five
down
went
another
of
the
reddleman
s
sovereigns
against
his
first
one
which
wildeve
laid
this
time
wildeve
threw
fifty
one
points
but
no
pair
the
reddleman
looked
grim
threw
a
raffle
of
aces
and
pocketed
the
stakes
here
you
are
again
said
wildeve
contemptuously
double
the
stakes
he
laid
two
of
thomasin
s
guineas
and
the
reddleman
his
two
pounds
venn
won
again
new
stakes
were
laid
on
the
stone
and
the
gamblers
proceeded
as
before
wildeve
was
a
nervous
and
excitable
man
and
the
game
was
beginning
to
tell
upon
his
temper
he
writhed
fumed
shifted
his
seat
and
the
beating
of
his
heart
was
almost
audible
venn
sat
with
lips
impassively
closed
and
eyes
reduced
to
a
pair
of
unimportant
twinkles
he
scarcely
appeared
to
breathe
he
might
have
been
an
arab
or
an
automaton
he
would
have
been
like
a
red
sandstone
statue
but
for
the
motion
of
his
arm
with
the
dice
box
the
game
fluctuated
now
in
favour
of
one
now
in
favour
of
the
other
without
any
great
advantage
on
the
side
of
either
nearly
twenty
minutes
were
passed
thus
the
light
of
the
candle
had
by
this
time
attracted
heath
flies
moths
and
other
winged
creatures
of
night
which
floated
round
the
lantern
flew
into
the
flame
or
beat
about
the
faces
of
the
two
players
but
neither
of
the
men
paid
much
attention
to
these
things
their
eyes
being
concentrated
upon
the
little
flat
stone
which
to
them
was
an
arena
vast
and
important
as
a
battlefield
by
this
time
a
change
had
come
over
the
game
the
reddleman
won
continually
at
length
sixty
guineas
thomasin
s
fifty
and
ten
of
clym
s
had
passed
into
his
hands
wildeve
was
reckless
frantic
exasperated
won
back
his
coat
said
venn
slily
another
throw
and
the
money
went
the
same
way
won
back
his
hat
continued
venn
oh
oh
said
wildeve
won
back
his
watch
won
back
his
money
and
went
out
of
the
door
a
rich
man
added
venn
sentence
by
sentence
as
stake
after
stake
passed
over
to
him
five
more
shouted
wildeve
dashing
down
the
money
and
three
casts
be
hanged
one
shall
decide
the
red
automaton
opposite
lapsed
into
silence
nodded
and
followed
his
example
wildeve
rattled
the
box
and
threw
a
pair
of
sixes
and
five
points
he
clapped
his
hands
i
have
done
it
this
time
hurrah
there
are
two
playing
and
only
one
has
thrown
said
the
reddleman
quietly
bringing
down
the
box
the
eyes
of
each
were
then
so
intently
converged
upon
the
stone
that
one
could
fancy
their
beams
were
visible
like
rays
in
a
fog
venn
lifted
the
box
and
behold
a
triplet
of
sixes
was
disclosed
wildeve
was
full
of
fury
while
the
reddleman
was
grasping
the
stakes
wildeve
seized
the
dice
and
hurled
them
box
and
all
into
the
darkness
uttering
a
fearful
imprecation
then
he
arose
and
began
stamping
up
and
down
like
a
madman
it
is
all
over
then
said
venn
no
no
cried
wildeve
i
mean
to
have
another
chance
yet
i
must
but
my
good
man
what
have
you
done
with
the
dice
i
threw
them
away
it
was
a
momentary
irritation
what
a
fool
i
am
here
come
and
help
me
to
look
for
them
we
must
find
them
again
wildeve
snatched
up
the
lantern
and
began
anxiously
prowling
among
the
furze
and
fern
you
are
not
likely
to
find
them
there
said
venn
following
what
did
you
do
such
a
crazy
thing
as
that
for
here
s
the
box
the
dice
can
t
be
far
off
wildeve
turned
the
light
eagerly
upon
the
spot
where
venn
had
found
the
box
and
mauled
the
herbage
right
and
left
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
one
of
the
dice
was
found
they
searched
on
for
some
time
but
no
other
was
to
be
seen
never
mind
said
wildeve
let
s
play
with
one
agreed
said
venn
down
they
sat
again
and
recommenced
with
single
guinea
stakes
and
the
play
went
on
smartly
but
fortune
had
unmistakably
fallen
in
love
with
the
reddleman
tonight
he
won
steadily
till
he
was
the
owner
of
fourteen
more
of
the
gold
pieces
seventy
nine
of
the
hundred
guineas
were
his
wildeve
possessing
only
twenty
one
the
aspect
of
the
two
opponents
was
now
singular
apart
from
motions
a
complete
diorama
of
the
fluctuations
of
the
game
went
on
in
their
eyes
a
diminutive
candle
flame
was
mirrored
in
each
pupil
and
it
would
have
been
possible
to
distinguish
therein
between
the
moods
of
hope
and
the
moods
of
abandonment
even
as
regards
the
reddleman
though
his
facial
muscles
betrayed
nothing
at
all
wildeve
played
on
with
the
recklessness
of
despair
what
s
that
he
suddenly
exclaimed
hearing
a
rustle
and
they
both
looked
up
they
were
surrounded
by
dusky
forms
between
four
and
five
feet
high
standing
a
few
paces
beyond
the
rays
of
the
lantern
a
moment
s
inspection
revealed
that
the
encircling
figures
were
heath
croppers
their
heads
being
all
towards
the
players
at
whom
they
gazed
intently
hoosh
said
wildeve
and
the
whole
forty
or
fifty
animals
at
once
turned
and
galloped
away
play
was
again
resumed
ten
minutes
passed
away
then
a
large
death
s
head
moth
advanced
from
the
obscure
outer
air
wheeled
twice
round
the
lantern
flew
straight
at
the
candle
and
extinguished
it
by
the
force
of
the
blow
wildeve
had
just
thrown
but
had
not
lifted
the
box
to
see
what
he
had
cast
and
now
it
was
impossible
what
the
infernal
he
shrieked
now
what
shall
we
do
perhaps
i
have
thrown
six
have
you
any
matches
none
said
venn
christian
had
some
i
wonder
where
he
is
christian
but
there
was
no
reply
to
wildeve
s
shout
save
a
mournful
whining
from
the
herons
which
were
nesting
lower
down
the
vale
both
men
looked
blankly
round
without
rising
as
their
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
darkness
they
perceived
faint
greenish
points
of
light
among
the
grass
and
fern
these
lights
dotted
the
hillside
like
stars
of
a
low
magnitude
ah
glowworms
said
wildeve
wait
a
minute
we
can
continue
the
game
venn
sat
still
and
his
companion
went
hither
and
thither
till
he
had
gathered
thirteen
glowworms
as
many
as
he
could
find
in
a
space
of
four
or
five
minutes
upon
a
fox
glove
leaf
which
he
pulled
for
the
purpose
the
reddleman
vented
a
low
humorous
laugh
when
he
saw
his
adversary
return
with
these
determined
to
go
on
then
he
said
drily
i
always
am
said
wildeve
angrily
and
shaking
the
glowworms
from
the
leaf
he
ranged
them
with
a
trembling
hand
in
a
circle
on
the
stone
leaving
a
space
in
the
middle
for
the
descent
of
the
dice
box
over
which
the
thirteen
tiny
lamps
threw
a
pale
phosphoric
shine
the
game
was
again
renewed
it
happened
to
be
that
season
of
the
year
at
which
glowworms
put
forth
their
greatest
brilliancy
and
the
light
they
yielded
was
more
than
ample
for
the
purpose
since
it
is
possible
on
such
nights
to
read
the
handwriting
of
a
letter
by
the
light
of
two
or
three
the
incongruity
between
the
men
s
deeds
and
their
environment
was
great
amid
the
soft
juicy
vegetation
of
the
hollow
in
which
they
sat
the
motionless
and
the
uninhabited
solitude
intruded
the
chink
of
guineas
the
rattle
of
dice
the
exclamations
of
the
reckless
players
wildeve
had
lifted
the
box
as
soon
as
the
lights
were
obtained
and
the
solitary
die
proclaimed
that
the
game
was
still
against
him
i
won
t
play
any
more
you
ve
been
tampering
with
the
dice
he
shouted
how
when
they
were
your
own
said
the
reddleman
we
ll
change
the
game
the
lowest
point
shall
win
the
stake
it
may
cut
off
my
ill
luck
do
you
refuse
no
go
on
said
venn
o
there
they
are
again
damn
them
cried
wildeve
looking
up
the
heath
croppers
had
returned
noiselessly
and
were
looking
on
with
erect
heads
just
as
before
their
timid
eyes
fixed
upon
the
scene
as
if
they
were
wondering
what
mankind
and
candlelight
could
have
to
do
in
these
haunts
at
this
untoward
hour
what
a
plague
those
creatures
are
staring
at
me
so
he
said
and
flung
a
stone
which
scattered
them
when
the
game
was
continued
as
before
wildeve
had
now
ten
guineas
left
and
each
laid
five
wildeve
threw
three
points
venn
two
and
raked
in
the
coins
the
other
seized
the
die
and
clenched
his
teeth
upon
it
in
sheer
rage
as
if
he
would
bite
it
in
pieces
never
give
in
here
are
my
last
five
he
cried
throwing
them
down
hang
the
glowworms
they
are
going
out
why
don
t
you
burn
you
little
fools
stir
them
up
with
a
thorn
he
probed
the
glowworms
with
a
bit
of
stick
and
rolled
them
over
till
the
bright
side
of
their
tails
was
upwards
there
s
light
enough
throw
on
said
venn
wildeve
brought
down
the
box
within
the
shining
circle
and
looked
eagerly
he
had
thrown
ace
well
done
i
said
it
would
turn
and
it
has
turned
venn
said
nothing
but
his
hand
shook
slightly
he
threw
ace
also
o
said
wildeve
curse
me
the
die
smacked
the
stone
a
second
time
it
was
ace
again
venn
looked
gloomy
threw
the
die
was
seen
to
be
lying
in
two
pieces
the
cleft
sides
uppermost
i
ve
thrown
nothing
at
all
he
said
serves
me
right
i
split
the
die
with
my
teeth
here
take
your
money
blank
is
less
than
one
i
don
t
wish
it
take
it
i
say
you
ve
won
it
and
wildeve
threw
the
stakes
against
the
reddleman
s
chest
venn
gathered
them
up
arose
and
withdrew
from
the
hollow
wildeve
sitting
stupefied
when
he
had
come
to
himself
he
also
arose
and
with
the
extinguished
lantern
in
his
hand
went
towards
the
highroad
on
reaching
it
he
stood
still
the
silence
of
night
pervaded
the
whole
heath
except
in
one
direction
and
that
was
towards
mistover
there
he
could
hear
the
noise
of
light
wheels
and
presently
saw
two
carriagelamps
descending
the
hill
wildeve
screened
himself
under
a
bush
and
waited
the
vehicle
came
on
and
passed
before
him
it
was
a
hired
carriage
and
behind
the
coachman
were
two
persons
whom
he
knew
well
there
sat
eustacia
and
yeobright
the
arm
of
the
latter
being
round
her
waist
they
turned
the
sharp
corner
at
the
bottom
towards
the
temporary
home
which
clym
had
hired
and
furnished
about
five
miles
to
the
eastward
wildeve
forgot
the
loss
of
the
money
at
the
sight
of
his
lost
love
whose
preciousness
in
his
eyes
was
increasing
in
geometrical
progression
with
each
new
incident
that
reminded
him
of
their
hopeless
division
brimming
with
the
subtilized
misery
that
he
was
capable
of
feeling
he
followed
the
opposite
way
towards
the
inn
about
the
same
moment
that
wildeve
stepped
into
the
highway
venn
also
had
reached
it
at
a
point
a
hundred
yards
further
on
and
he
hearing
the
same
wheels
likewise
waited
till
the
carriage
should
come
up
when
he
saw
who
sat
therein
he
seemed
to
be
disappointed
reflecting
a
minute
or
two
during
which
interval
the
carriage
rolled
on
he
crossed
the
road
and
took
a
short
cut
through
the
furze
and
heath
to
a
point
where
the
turnpike
road
bent
round
in
ascending
a
hill
he
was
now
again
in
front
of
the
carriage
which
presently
came
up
at
a
walking
pace
venn
stepped
forward
and
showed
himself
eustacia
started
when
the
lamp
shone
upon
him
and
clym
s
arm
was
involuntarily
withdrawn
from
her
waist
he
said
what
diggory
you
are
having
a
lonely
walk
yes
i
beg
your
pardon
for
stopping
you
said
venn
but
i
am
waiting
about
for
mrs
wildeve
i
have
something
to
give
her
from
mrs
yeobright
can
you
tell
me
if
she
s
gone
home
from
the
party
yet
no
but
she
will
be
leaving
soon
you
may
possibly
meet
her
at
the
corner
venn
made
a
farewell
obeisance
and
walked
back
to
his
former
position
where
the
byroad
from
mistover
joined
the
highway
here
he
remained
fixed
for
nearly
half
an
hour
and
then
another
pair
of
lights
came
down
the
hill
it
was
the
old
fashioned
wheeled
nondescript
belonging
to
the
captain
and
thomasin
sat
in
it
alone
driven
by
charley
the
reddleman
came
up
as
they
slowly
turned
the
corner
i
beg
pardon
for
stopping
you
mrs
wildeve
he
said
but
i
have
something
to
give
you
privately
from
mrs
yeobright
he
handed
a
small
parcel
it
consisted
of
the
hundred
guineas
he
had
just
won
roughly
twisted
up
in
a
piece
of
paper
thomasin
recovered
from
her
surprise
and
took
the
packet
that
s
all
ma
am
i
wish
you
good
night
he
said
and
vanished
from
her
view
thus
venn
in
his
anxiety
to
rectify
matters
had
placed
in
thomasin
s
hands
not
only
the
fifty
guineas
which
rightly
belonged
to
her
but
also
the
fifty
intended
for
her
cousin
clym
his
mistake
had
been
based
upon
wildeve
s
words
at
the
opening
of
the
game
when
he
indignantly
denied
that
the
guinea
was
not
his
own
it
had
not
been
comprehended
by
the
reddleman
that
at
halfway
through
the
performance
the
game
was
continued
with
the
money
of
another
person
and
it
was
an
error
which
afterwards
helped
to
cause
more
misfortune
than
treble
the
loss
in
money
value
could
have
done
the
night
was
now
somewhat
advanced
and
venn
plunged
deeper
into
the
heath
till
he
came
to
a
ravine
where
his
van
was
standing
a
spot
not
more
than
two
hundred
yards
from
the
site
of
the
gambling
bout
he
entered
this
movable
home
of
his
lit
his
lantern
and
before
closing
his
door
for
the
night
stood
reflecting
on
the
circumstances
of
the
preceding
hours
while
he
stood
the
dawn
grew
visible
in
the
northeast
quarter
of
the
heavens
which
the
clouds
having
cleared
off
was
bright
with
a
soft
sheen
at
this
midsummer
time
though
it
was
only
between
one
and
two
o
clock
venn
thoroughly
weary
then
shut
his
door
and
flung
himself
down
to
sleep
book
four
the
closed
door
the
rencounter
by
the
pool
the
july
sun
shone
over
egdon
and
fired
its
crimson
heather
to
scarlet
it
was
the
one
season
of
the
year
and
the
one
weather
of
the
season
in
which
the
heath
was
gorgeous
this
flowering
period
represented
the
second
or
noontide
division
in
the
cycle
of
those
superficial
changes
which
alone
were
possible
here
it
followed
the
green
or
young
fern
period
representing
the
morn
and
preceded
the
brown
period
when
the
heathbells
and
ferns
would
wear
the
russet
tinges
of
evening
to
be
in
turn
displaced
by
the
dark
hue
of
the
winter
period
representing
night
clym
and
eustacia
in
their
little
house
at
alderworth
beyond
east
egdon
were
living
on
with
a
monotony
which
was
delightful
to
them
the
heath
and
changes
of
weather
were
quite
blotted
out
from
their
eyes
for
the
present
they
were
enclosed
in
a
sort
of
luminous
mist
which
hid
from
them
surroundings
of
any
inharmonious
colour
and
gave
to
all
things
the
character
of
light
when
it
rained
they
were
charmed
because
they
could
remain
indoors
together
all
day
with
such
a
show
of
reason
when
it
was
fine
they
were
charmed
because
they
could
sit
together
on
the
hills
they
were
like
those
double
stars
which
revolve
round
and
round
each
other
and
from
a
distance
appear
to
be
one
the
absolute
solitude
in
which
they
lived
intensified
their
reciprocal
thoughts
yet
some
might
have
said
that
it
had
the
disadvantage
of
consuming
their
mutual
affections
at
a
fearfully
prodigal
rate
yeobright
did
not
fear
for
his
own
part
but
recollection
of
eustacia
s
old
speech
about
the
evanescence
of
love
now
apparently
forgotten
by
her
sometimes
caused
him
to
ask
himself
a
question
and
he
recoiled
at
the
thought
that
the
quality
of
finiteness
was
not
foreign
to
eden
when
three
or
four
weeks
had
been
passed
thus
yeobright
resumed
his
reading
in
earnest
to
make
up
for
lost
time
he
studied
indefatigably
for
he
wished
to
enter
his
new
profession
with
the
least
possible
delay
now
eustacia
s
dream
had
always
been
that
once
married
to
clym
she
would
have
the
power
of
inducing
him
to
return
to
paris
he
had
carefully
withheld
all
promise
to
do
so
but
would
he
be
proof
against
her
coaxing
and
argument
she
had
calculated
to
such
a
degree
on
the
probability
of
success
that
she
had
represented
paris
and
not
budmouth
to
her
grandfather
as
in
all
likelihood
their
future
home
her
hopes
were
bound
up
in
this
dream
in
the
quiet
days
since
their
marriage
when
yeobright
had
been
poring
over
her
lips
her
eyes
and
the
lines
of
her
face
she
had
mused
and
mused
on
the
subject
even
while
in
the
act
of
returning
his
gaze
and
now
the
sight
of
the
books
indicating
a
future
which
was
antagonistic
to
her
dream
struck
her
with
a
positively
painful
jar
she
was
hoping
for
the
time
when
as
the
mistress
of
some
pretty
establishment
however
small
near
a
parisian
boulevard
she
would
be
passing
her
days
on
the
skirts
at
least
of
the
gay
world
and
catching
stray
wafts
from
those
town
pleasures
she
was
so
well
fitted
to
enjoy
yet
yeobright
was
as
firm
in
the
contrary
intention
as
if
the
tendency
of
marriage
were
rather
to
develop
the
fantasies
of
young
philanthropy
than
to
sweep
them
away
her
anxiety
reached
a
high
pitch
but
there
was
something
in
clym
s
undeviating
manner
which
made
her
hesitate
before
sounding
him
on
the
subject
at
this
point
in
their
experience
however
an
incident
helped
her
it
occurred
one
evening
about
six
weeks
after
their
union
and
arose
entirely
out
of
the
unconscious
misapplication
of
venn
of
the
fifty
guineas
intended
for
yeobright
a
day
or
two
after
the
receipt
of
the
money
thomasin
had
sent
a
note
to
her
aunt
to
thank
her
she
had
been
surprised
at
the
largeness
of
the
amount
but
as
no
sum
had
ever
been
mentioned
she
set
that
down
to
her
late
uncle
s
generosity
she
had
been
strictly
charged
by
her
aunt
to
say
nothing
to
her
husband
of
this
gift
and
wildeve
as
was
natural
enough
had
not
brought
himself
to
mention
to
his
wife
a
single
particular
of
the
midnight
scene
in
the
heath
christian
s
terror
in
like
manner
had
tied
his
tongue
on
the
share
he
took
in
that
proceeding
and
hoping
that
by
some
means
or
other
the
money
had
gone
to
its
proper
destination
he
simply
asserted
as
much
without
giving
details
therefore
when
a
week
or
two
had
passed
away
mrs
yeobright
began
to
wonder
why
she
never
heard
from
her
son
of
the
receipt
of
the
present
and
to
add
gloom
to
her
perplexity
came
the
possibility
that
resentment
might
be
the
cause
of
his
silence
she
could
hardly
believe
as
much
but
why
did
he
not
write
she
questioned
christian
and
the
confusion
in
his
answers
would
at
once
have
led
her
to
believe
that
something
was
wrong
had
not
one
half
of
his
story
been
corroborated
by
thomasin
s
note
mrs
yeobright
was
in
this
state
of
uncertainty
when
she
was
informed
one
morning
that
her
son
s
wife
was
visiting
her
grandfather
at
mistover
she
determined
to
walk
up
the
hill
see
eustacia
and
ascertain
from
her
daughter
in
law
s
lips
whether
the
family
guineas
which
were
to
mrs
yeobright
what
family
jewels
are
to
wealthier
dowagers
had
miscarried
or
not
when
christian
learnt
where
she
was
going
his
concern
reached
its
height
at
the
moment
of
her
departure
he
could
prevaricate
no
longer
and
confessing
to
the
gambling
told
her
the
truth
as
far
as
he
knew
it
that
the
guineas
had
been
won
by
wildeve
what
is
he
going
to
keep
them
mrs
yeobright
cried
i
hope
and
trust
not
moaned
christian
he
s
a
good
man
and
perhaps
will
do
right
things
he
said
you
ought
to
have
gied
mr
clym
s
share
to
eustacia
and
that
s
perhaps
what
he
ll
do
himself
to
mrs
yeobright
as
soon
as
she
could
calmly
reflect
there
was
much
likelihood
in
this
for
she
could
hardly
believe
that
wildeve
would
really
appropriate
money
belonging
to
her
son
the
intermediate
course
of
giving
it
to
eustacia
was
the
sort
of
thing
to
please
wildeve
s
fancy
but
it
filled
the
mother
with
anger
none
the
less
that
wildeve
should
have
got
command
of
the
guineas
after
all
and
should
rearrange
the
disposal
of
them
placing
clym
s
share
in
clym
s
wife
s
hands
because
she
had
been
his
own
sweetheart
and
might
be
so
still
was
as
irritating
a
pain
as
any
that
mrs
yeobright
had
ever
borne
she
instantly
dismissed
the
wretched
christian
from
her
employ
for
his
conduct
in
the
affair
but
feeling
quite
helpless
and
unable
to
do
without
him
told
him
afterwards
that
he
might
stay
a
little
longer
if
he
chose
then
she
hastened
off
to
eustacia
moved
by
a
much
less
promising
emotion
towards
her
daughter
in
law
than
she
had
felt
half
an
hour
earlier
when
planning
her
journey
at
that
time
it
was
to
inquire
in
a
friendly
spirit
if
there
had
been
any
accidental
loss
now
it
was
to
ask
plainly
if
wildeve
had
privately
given
her
money
which
had
been
intended
as
a
sacred
gift
to
clym
she
started
at
two
o
clock
and
her
meeting
with
eustacia
was
hastened
by
the
appearance
of
the
young
lady
beside
the
pool
and
bank
which
bordered
her
grandfather
s
premises
where
she
stood
surveying
the
scene
and
perhaps
thinking
of
the
romantic
enactments
it
had
witnessed
in
past
days
when
mrs
yeobright
approached
eustacia
surveyed
her
with
the
calm
stare
of
a
stranger
the
mother
in
law
was
the
first
to
speak
i
was
coming
to
see
you
she
said
indeed
said
eustacia
with
surprise
for
mrs
yeobright
much
to
the
girl
s
mortification
had
refused
to
be
present
at
the
wedding
i
did
not
at
all
expect
you
i
was
coming
on
business
only
said
the
visitor
more
coldly
than
at
first
will
you
excuse
my
asking
this
have
you
received
a
gift
from
thomasin
s
husband
a
gift
i
mean
money
what
i
myself
well
i
meant
yourself
privately
though
i
was
not
going
to
put
it
in
that
way
money
from
mr
wildeve
no
never
madam
what
do
you
mean
by
that
eustacia
fired
up
all
too
quickly
for
her
own
consciousness
of
the
old
attachment
between
herself
and
wildeve
led
her
to
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
mrs
yeobright
also
knew
of
it
and
might
have
come
to
accuse
her
of
receiving
dishonourable
presents
from
him
now
i
simply
ask
the
question
said
mrs
yeobright
i
have
been
you
ought
to
have
better
opinions
of
me
i
feared
you
were
against
me
from
the
first
exclaimed
eustacia
no
i
was
simply
for
clym
replied
mrs
yeobright
with
too
much
emphasis
in
her
earnestness
it
is
the
instinct
of
everyone
to
look
after
their
own
how
can
you
imply
that
he
required
guarding
against
me
cried
eustacia
passionate
tears
in
her
eyes
i
have
not
injured
him
by
marrying
him
what
sin
have
i
done
that
you
should
think
so
ill
of
me
you
had
no
right
to
speak
against
me
to
him
when
i
have
never
wronged
you
i
only
did
what
was
fair
under
the
circumstances
said
mrs
yeobright
more
softly
i
would
rather
not
have
gone
into
this
question
at
present
but
you
compel
me
i
am
not
ashamed
to
tell
you
the
honest
truth
i
was
firmly
convinced
that
he
ought
not
to
marry
you
therefore
i
tried
to
dissuade
him
by
all
the
means
in
my
power
but
it
is
done
now
and
i
have
no
idea
of
complaining
any
more
i
am
ready
to
welcome
you
ah
yes
it
is
very
well
to
see
things
in
that
business
point
of
view
murmured
eustacia
with
a
smothered
fire
of
feeling
but
why
should
you
think
there
is
anything
between
me
and
mr
wildeve
i
have
a
spirit
as
well
as
you
i
am
indignant
and
so
would
any
woman
be
it
was
a
condescension
in
me
to
be
clym
s
wife
and
not
a
manoeuvre
let
me
remind
you
and
therefore
i
will
not
be
treated
as
a
schemer
whom
it
becomes
necessary
to
bear
with
because
she
has
crept
into
the
family
oh
said
mrs
yeobright
vainly
endeavouring
to
control
her
anger
i
have
never
heard
anything
to
show
that
my
son
s
lineage
is
not
as
good
as
the
vyes
perhaps
better
it
is
amusing
to
hear
you
talk
of
condescension
it
was
condescension
nevertheless
said
eustacia
vehemently
and
if
i
had
known
then
what
i
know
now
that
i
should
be
living
in
this
wild
heath
a
month
after
my
marriage
i
i
should
have
thought
twice
before
agreeing
it
would
be
better
not
to
say
that
it
might
not
sound
truthful
i
am
not
aware
that
any
deception
was
used
on
his
part
i
know
there
was
not
whatever
might
have
been
the
case
on
the
other
side
this
is
too
exasperating
answered
the
younger
woman
huskily
her
face
crimsoning
and
her
eyes
darting
light
how
can
you
dare
to
speak
to
me
like
that
i
insist
upon
repeating
to
you
that
had
i
known
that
my
life
would
from
my
marriage
up
to
this
time
have
been
as
it
is
i
should
have
said
no
i
don
t
complain
i
have
never
uttered
a
sound
of
such
a
thing
to
him
but
it
is
true
i
hope
therefore
that
in
the
future
you
will
be
silent
on
my
eagerness
if
you
injure
me
now
you
injure
yourself
injure
you
do
you
think
i
am
an
evil
disposed
person
you
injured
me
before
my
marriage
and
you
have
now
suspected
me
of
secretly
favouring
another
man
for
money
i
could
not
help
what
i
thought
but
i
have
never
spoken
of
you
outside
my
house
you
spoke
of
me
within
it
to
clym
and
you
could
not
do
worse
i
did
my
duty
and
i
ll
do
mine
a
part
of
which
will
possibly
be
to
set
him
against
his
mother
it
is
always
so
but
why
should
i
not
bear
it
as
others
have
borne
it
before
me
i
understand
you
said
eustacia
breathless
with
emotion
you
think
me
capable
of
every
bad
thing
who
can
be
worse
than
a
wife
who
encourages
a
lover
and
poisons
her
husband
s
mind
against
his
relative
yet
that
is
now
the
character
given
to
me
will
you
not
come
and
drag
him
out
of
my
hands
mrs
yeobright
gave
back
heat
for
heat
don
t
rage
at
me
madam
it
ill
becomes
your
beauty
and
i
am
not
worth
the
injury
you
may
do
it
on
my
account
i
assure
you
i
am
only
a
poor
old
woman
who
has
lost
a
son
if
you
had
treated
me
honourably
you
would
have
had
him
still
eustacia
said
while
scalding
tears
trickled
from
her
eyes
you
have
brought
yourself
to
folly
you
have
caused
a
division
which
can
never
be
healed
i
have
done
nothing
this
audacity
from
a
young
woman
is
more
than
i
can
bear
it
was
asked
for
you
have
suspected
me
and
you
have
made
me
speak
of
my
husband
in
a
way
i
would
not
have
done
you
will
let
him
know
that
i
have
spoken
thus
and
it
will
cause
misery
between
us
will
you
go
away
from
me
you
are
no
friend
i
will
go
when
i
have
spoken
a
word
if
anyone
says
i
have
come
here
to
question
you
without
good
grounds
for
it
that
person
speaks
untruly
if
anyone
says
that
i
attempted
to
stop
your
marriage
by
any
but
honest
means
that
person
too
does
not
speak
the
truth
i
have
fallen
on
an
evil
time
god
has
been
unjust
to
me
in
letting
you
insult
me
probably
my
son
s
happiness
does
not
lie
on
this
side
of
the
grave
for
he
is
a
foolish
man
who
neglects
the
advice
of
his
parent
you
eustacia
stand
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
without
knowing
it
only
show
my
son
one
half
the
temper
you
have
shown
me
today
and
you
may
before
long
and
you
will
find
that
though
he
is
as
gentle
as
a
child
with
you
now
he
can
be
as
hard
as
steel
the
excited
mother
then
withdrew
and
eustacia
panting
stood
looking
into
the
pool
he
is
set
upon
by
adversities
but
he
sings
a
song
the
result
of
that
unpropitious
interview
was
that
eustacia
instead
of
passing
the
afternoon
with
her
grandfather
hastily
returned
home
to
clym
where
she
arrived
three
hours
earlier
than
she
had
been
expected
she
came
indoors
with
her
face
flushed
and
her
eyes
still
showing
traces
of
her
recent
excitement
yeobright
looked
up
astonished
he
had
never
seen
her
in
any
way
approaching
to
that
state
before
she
passed
him
by
and
would
have
gone
upstairs
unnoticed
but
clym
was
so
concerned
that
he
immediately
followed
her
what
is
the
matter
eustacia
he
said
she
was
standing
on
the
hearthrug
in
the
bedroom
looking
upon
the
floor
her
hands
clasped
in
front
of
her
her
bonnet
yet
unremoved
for
a
moment
she
did
not
answer
and
then
she
replied
in
a
low
voice
i
have
seen
your
mother
and
i
will
never
see
her
again
a
weight
fell
like
a
stone
upon
clym
that
same
morning
when
eustacia
had
arranged
to
go
and
see
her
grandfather
clym
had
expressed
a
wish
that
she
would
drive
down
to
blooms
end
and
inquire
for
her
mother
in
law
or
adopt
any
other
means
she
might
think
fit
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
she
had
set
out
gaily
and
he
had
hoped
for
much
why
is
this
he
asked
i
cannot
tell
i
cannot
remember
i
met
your
mother
and
i
will
never
meet
her
again
why
what
do
i
know
about
mr
wildeve
now
i
won
t
have
wicked
opinions
passed
on
me
by
anybody
o
it
was
too
humiliating
to
be
asked
if
i
had
received
any
money
from
him
or
encouraged
him
or
something
of
the
sort
i
don
t
exactly
know
what
how
could
she
have
asked
you
that
she
did
then
there
must
have
been
some
meaning
in
it
what
did
my
mother
say
besides
i
don
t
know
what
she
said
except
in
so
far
as
this
that
we
both
said
words
which
can
never
be
forgiven
oh
there
must
be
some
misapprehension
whose
fault
was
it
that
her
meaning
was
not
made
clear
i
would
rather
not
say
it
may
have
been
the
fault
of
the
circumstances
which
were
awkward
at
the
very
least
o
clym
i
cannot
help
expressing
it
this
is
an
unpleasant
position
that
you
have
placed
me
in
but
you
must
improve
it
yes
say
you
will
for
i
hate
it
all
now
yes
take
me
to
paris
and
go
on
with
your
old
occupation
clym
i
don
t
mind
how
humbly
we
live
there
at
first
if
it
can
only
be
paris
and
not
egdon
heath
but
i
have
quite
given
up
that
idea
said
yeobright
with
surprise
surely
i
never
led
you
to
expect
such
a
thing
i
own
it
yet
there
are
thoughts
which
cannot
be
kept
out
of
mind
and
that
one
was
mine
must
i
not
have
a
voice
in
the
matter
now
i
am
your
wife
and
the
sharer
of
your
doom
well
there
are
things
which
are
placed
beyond
the
pale
of
discussion
and
i
thought
this
was
specially
so
and
by
mutual
agreement
clym
i
am
unhappy
at
what
i
hear
she
said
in
a
low
voice
and
her
eyes
drooped
and
she
turned
away
this
indication
of
an
unexpected
mine
of
hope
in
eustacia
s
bosom
disconcerted
her
husband
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
confronted
the
fact
of
the
indirectness
of
a
woman
s
movement
towards
her
desire
but
his
intention
was
unshaken
though
he
loved
eustacia
well
all
the
effect
that
her
remark
had
upon
him
was
a
resolve
to
chain
himself
more
closely
than
ever
to
his
books
so
as
to
be
the
sooner
enabled
to
appeal
to
substantial
results
from
another
course
in
arguing
against
her
whim
next
day
the
mystery
of
the
guineas
was
explained
thomasin
paid
them
a
hurried
visit
and
clym
s
share
was
delivered
up
to
him
by
her
own
hands
eustacia
was
not
present
at
the
time
then
this
is
what
my
mother
meant
exclaimed
clym
thomasin
do
you
know
that
they
have
had
a
bitter
quarrel
there
was
a
little
more
reticence
now
than
formerly
in
thomasin
s
manner
towards
her
cousin
it
is
the
effect
of
marriage
to
engender
in
several
directions
some
of
the
reserve
it
annihilates
in
one
your
mother
told
me
she
said
quietly
she
came
back
to
my
house
after
seeing
eustacia
the
worst
thing
i
dreaded
has
come
to
pass
was
mother
much
disturbed
when
she
came
to
you
thomasin
yes
very
much
indeed
yes
clym
leant
his
elbow
upon
the
post
of
the
garden
gate
and
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hand
don
t
trouble
about
it
clym
they
may
get
to
be
friends
he
shook
his
head
not
two
people
with
inflammable
natures
like
theirs
well
what
must
be
will
be
one
thing
is
cheerful
in
it
the
guineas
are
not
lost
i
would
rather
have
lost
them
twice
over
than
have
had
this
happen
amid
these
jarring
events
yeobright
felt
one
thing
to
be
indispensable
that
he
should
speedily
make
some
show
of
progress
in
his
scholastic
plans
with
this
view
he
read
far
into
the
small
hours
during
many
nights
one
morning
after
a
severer
strain
than
usual
he
awoke
with
a
strange
sensation
in
his
eyes
the
sun
was
shining
directly
upon
the
window
blind
and
at
his
first
glance
thitherward
a
sharp
pain
obliged
him
to
close
his
eyelids
quickly
at
every
new
attempt
to
look
about
him
the
same
morbid
sensibility
to
light
was
manifested
and
excoriating
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
he
was
obliged
to
tie
a
bandage
over
his
brow
while
dressing
and
during
the
day
it
could
not
be
abandoned
eustacia
was
thoroughly
alarmed
on
finding
that
the
case
was
no
better
the
next
morning
they
decided
to
send
to
anglebury
for
a
surgeon
towards
evening
he
arrived
and
pronounced
the
disease
to
be
acute
inflammation
induced
by
clym
s
night
studies
continued
in
spite
of
a
cold
previously
caught
which
had
weakened
his
eyes
for
the
time
fretting
with
impatience
at
this
interruption
to
a
task
he
was
so
anxious
to
hasten
clym
was
transformed
into
an
invalid
he
was
shut
up
in
a
room
from
which
all
light
was
excluded
and
his
condition
would
have
been
one
of
absolute
misery
had
not
eustacia
read
to
him
by
the
glimmer
of
a
shaded
lamp
he
hoped
that
the
worst
would
soon
be
over
but
at
the
surgeon
s
third
visit
he
learnt
to
his
dismay
that
although
he
might
venture
out
of
doors
with
shaded
eyes
in
the
course
of
a
month
all
thought
of
pursuing
his
work
or
of
reading
print
of
any
description
would
have
to
be
given
up
for
a
long
time
to
come
one
week
and
another
week
wore
on
and
nothing
seemed
to
lighten
the
gloom
of
the
young
couple
dreadful
imaginings
occurred
to
eustacia
but
she
carefully
refrained
from
uttering
them
to
her
husband
suppose
he
should
become
blind
or
at
all
events
never
recover
sufficient
strength
of
sight
to
engage
in
an
occupation
which
would
be
congenial
to
her
feelings
and
conduce
to
her
removal
from
this
lonely
dwelling
among
the
hills
that
dream
of
beautiful
paris
was
not
likely
to
cohere
into
substance
in
the
presence
of
this
misfortune
as
day
after
day
passed
by
and
he
got
no
better
her
mind
ran
more
and
more
in
this
mournful
groove
and
she
would
go
away
from
him
into
the
garden
and
weep
despairing
tears
yeobright
thought
he
would
send
for
his
mother
and
then
he
thought
he
would
not
knowledge
of
his
state
could
only
make
her
the
more
unhappy
and
the
seclusion
of
their
life
was
such
that
she
would
hardly
be
likely
to
learn
the
news
except
through
a
special
messenger
endeavouring
to
take
the
trouble
as
philosophically
as
possible
he
waited
on
till
the
third
week
had
arrived
when
he
went
into
the
open
air
for
the
first
time
since
the
attack
the
surgeon
visited
him
again
at
this
stage
and
clym
urged
him
to
express
a
distinct
opinion
the
young
man
learnt
with
added
surprise
that
the
date
at
which
he
might
expect
to
resume
his
labours
was
as
uncertain
as
ever
his
eyes
being
in
that
peculiar
state
which
though
affording
him
sight
enough
for
walking
about
would
not
admit
of
their
being
strained
upon
any
definite
object
without
incurring
the
risk
of
reproducing
ophthalmia
in
its
acute
form
clym
was
very
grave
at
the
intelligence
but
not
despairing
a
quiet
firmness
and
even
cheerfulness
took
possession
of
him
he
was
not
to
be
blind
that
was
enough
to
be
doomed
to
behold
the
world
through
smoked
glass
for
an
indefinite
period
was
bad
enough
and
fatal
to
any
kind
of
advance
but
yeobright
was
an
absolute
stoic
in
the
face
of
mishaps
which
only
affected
his
social
standing
and
apart
from
eustacia
the
humblest
walk
of
life
would
satisfy
him
if
it
could
be
made
to
work
in
with
some
form
of
his
culture
scheme
to
keep
a
cottage
night
school
was
one
such
form
and
his
affliction
did
not
master
his
spirit
as
it
might
otherwise
have
done
he
walked
through
the
warm
sun
westward
into
those
tracts
of
egdon
with
which
he
was
best
acquainted
being
those
lying
nearer
to
his
old
home
he
saw
before
him
in
one
of
the
valleys
the
gleaming
of
whetted
iron
and
advancing
dimly
perceived
that
the
shine
came
from
the
tool
of
a
man
who
was
cutting
furze
the
worker
recognized
clym
and
yeobright
learnt
from
the
voice
that
the
speaker
was
humphrey
humphrey
expressed
his
sorrow
at
clym
s
condition
and
added
now
if
yours
was
low
class
work
like
mine
you
could
go
on
with
it
just
the
same
yes
i
could
said
yeobright
musingly
how
much
do
you
get
for
cutting
these
faggots
half
a
crown
a
hundred
and
in
these
long
days
i
can
live
very
well
on
the
wages
during
the
whole
of
yeobright
s
walk
home
to
alderworth
he
was
lost
in
reflections
which
were
not
of
an
unpleasant
kind
on
his
coming
up
to
the
house
eustacia
spoke
to
him
from
the
open
window
and
he
went
across
to
her
darling
he
said
i
am
much
happier
and
if
my
mother
were
reconciled
to
me
and
to
you
i
should
i
think
be
happy
quite
i
fear
that
will
never
be
she
said
looking
afar
with
her
beautiful
stormy
eyes
how
can
you
say
i
am
happier
and
nothing
changed
it
arises
from
my
having
at
last
discovered
something
i
can
do
and
get
a
living
at
in
this
time
of
misfortune
yes
i
am
going
to
be
a
furze
and
turf
cutter
no
clym
she
said
the
slight
hopefulness
previously
apparent
in
her
face
going
off
again
and
leaving
her
worse
than
before
surely
i
shall
is
it
not
very
unwise
in
us
to
go
on
spending
the
little
money
we
ve
got
when
i
can
keep
down
expenditures
by
an
honest
occupation
the
outdoor
exercise
will
do
me
good
and
who
knows
but
that
in
a
few
months
i
shall
be
able
to
go
on
with
my
reading
again
but
my
grandfather
offers
to
assist
us
if
we
require
assistance
we
don
t
require
it
if
i
go
furze
cutting
we
shall
be
fairly
well
off
in
comparison
with
slaves
and
the
israelites
in
egypt
and
such
people
a
bitter
tear
rolled
down
eustacia
s
face
which
he
did
not
see
there
had
been
nonchalance
in
his
tone
showing
her
that
he
felt
no
absolute
grief
at
a
consummation
which
to
her
was
a
positive
horror
the
very
next
day
yeobright
went
to
humphrey
s
cottage
and
borrowed
of
him
leggings
gloves
a
whetstone
and
a
hook
to
use
till
he
should
be
able
to
purchase
some
for
himself
then
he
sallied
forth
with
his
new
fellow
labourer
and
old
acquaintance
and
selecting
a
spot
where
the
furze
grew
thickest
he
struck
the
first
blow
in
his
adopted
calling
his
sight
like
the
wings
in
rasselas
though
useless
to
him
for
his
grand
purpose
sufficed
for
this
strait
and
he
found
that
when
a
little
practice
should
have
hardened
his
palms
against
blistering
he
would
be
able
to
work
with
ease
day
after
day
he
rose
with
the
sun
buckled
on
his
leggings
and
went
off
to
the
rendezvous
with
humphrey
his
custom
was
to
work
from
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
till
noon
then
when
the
heat
of
the
day
was
at
its
highest
to
go
home
and
sleep
for
an
hour
or
two
afterwards
coming
out
again
and
working
till
dusk
at
nine
this
man
from
paris
was
now
so
disguised
by
his
leather
accoutrements
and
by
the
goggles
he
was
obliged
to
wear
over
his
eyes
that
his
closest
friend
might
have
passed
by
without
recognizing
him
he
was
a
brown
spot
in
the
midst
of
an
expanse
of
olive
green
gorse
and
nothing
more
though
frequently
depressed
in
spirit
when
not
actually
at
work
owing
to
thoughts
of
eustacia
s
position
and
his
mother
s
estrangement
when
in
the
full
swing
of
labour
he
was
cheerfully
disposed
and
calm
his
daily
life
was
of
a
curious
microscopic
sort
his
whole
world
being
limited
to
a
circuit
of
a
few
feet
from
his
person
his
familiars
were
creeping
and
winged
things
and
they
seemed
to
enroll
him
in
their
band
bees
hummed
around
his
ears
with
an
intimate
air
and
tugged
at
the
heath
and
furze
flowers
at
his
side
in
such
numbers
as
to
weigh
them
down
to
the
sod
the
strange
amber
coloured
butterflies
which
egdon
produced
and
which
were
never
seen
elsewhere
quivered
in
the
breath
of
his
lips
alighted
upon
his
bowed
back
and
sported
with
the
glittering
point
of
his
hook
as
he
flourished
it
up
and
down
tribes
of
emerald
green
grasshoppers
leaped
over
his
feet
falling
awkwardly
on
their
backs
heads
or
hips
like
unskilful
acrobats
as
chance
might
rule
or
engaged
themselves
in
noisy
flirtations
under
the
fern
fronds
with
silent
ones
of
homely
hue
huge
flies
ignorant
of
larders
and
wire
netting
and
quite
in
a
savage
state
buzzed
about
him
without
knowing
that
he
was
a
man
in
and
out
of
the
fern
dells
snakes
glided
in
their
most
brilliant
blue
and
yellow
guise
it
being
the
season
immediately
following
the
shedding
of
their
old
skins
when
their
colours
are
brightest
litters
of
young
rabbits
came
out
from
their
forms
to
sun
themselves
upon
hillocks
the
hot
beams
blazing
through
the
delicate
tissue
of
each
thin
fleshed
ear
and
firing
it
to
a
blood
red
transparency
in
which
the
veins
could
be
seen
none
of
them
feared
him
the
monotony
of
his
occupation
soothed
him
and
was
in
itself
a
pleasure
a
forced
limitation
of
effort
offered
a
justification
of
homely
courses
to
an
unambitious
man
whose
conscience
would
hardly
have
allowed
him
to
remain
in
such
obscurity
while
his
powers
were
unimpeded
hence
yeobright
sometimes
sang
to
himself
and
when
obliged
to
accompany
humphrey
in
search
of
brambles
for
faggot
bonds
he
would
amuse
his
companion
with
sketches
of
parisian
life
and
character
and
so
while
away
the
time
on
one
of
these
warm
afternoons
eustacia
walked
out
alone
in
the
direction
of
yeobright
s
place
of
work
he
was
busily
chopping
away
at
the
furze
a
long
row
of
faggots
which
stretched
downward
from
his
position
representing
the
labour
of
the
day
he
did
not
observe
her
approach
and
she
stood
close
to
him
and
heard
his
undercurrent
of
song
it
shocked
her
to
see
him
there
a
poor
afflicted
man
earning
money
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
had
at
first
moved
her
to
tears
but
to
hear
him
sing
and
not
at
all
rebel
against
an
occupation
which
however
satisfactory
to
himself
was
degrading
to
her
as
an
educated
lady
wife
wounded
her
through
unconscious
of
her
presence
he
still
went
on
singing
le
point
du
jour
a
nos
bosquets
rend
toute
leur
parure
flore
est
plus
belle
a
son
retour
l
oiseau
reprend

tout
celebre
dans
la
nature
le

le

des

est
court
pour
le
berger
brulant
d
amour
force
de
quitter
ce
qu
il
aime
au
point
du
jour
it
was
bitterly
plain
to
eustacia
that
he
did
not
care
much
about
social
failure
and
the
proud
fair
woman
bowed
her
head
and
wept
in
sick
despair
at
thought
of
the
blasting
effect
upon
her
own
life
of
that
mood
and
condition
in
him
then
she
came
forward
i
would
starve
rather
than
do
it
she
exclaimed
vehemently
and
you
can
sing
i
will
go
and
live
with
my
grandfather
again
eustacia
i
did
not
see
you
though
i
noticed
something
moving
he
said
gently
he
came
forward
pulled
off
his
huge
leather
glove
and
took
her
hand
why
do
you
speak
in
such
a
strange
way
it
is
only
a
little
old
song
which
struck
my
fancy
when
i
was
in
paris
and
now
just
applies
to
my
life
with
you
has
your
love
for
me
all
died
then
because
my
appearance
is
no
longer
that
of
a
fine
gentleman
dearest
you
must
not
question
me
unpleasantly
or
it
may
make
me
not
love
you
do
you
believe
it
possible
that
i
would
run
the
risk
of
doing
that
well
you
follow
out
your
own
ideas
and
won
t
give
in
to
mine
when
i
wish
you
to
leave
off
this
shameful
labour
is
there
anything
you
dislike
in
me
that
you
act
so
contrarily
to
my
wishes
i
am
your
wife
and
why
will
you
not
listen
yes
i
am
your
wife
indeed
i
know
what
that
tone
means
what
tone
the
tone
in
which
you
said
your
wife
indeed
it
meant
your
wife
worse
luck
it
is
hard
in
you
to
probe
me
with
that
remark
a
woman
may
have
reason
though
she
is
not
without
heart
and
if
i
felt
worse
luck
it
was
no
ignoble
feeling
it
was
only
too
natural
there
you
see
that
at
any
rate
i
do
not
attempt
untruths
do
you
remember
how
before
we
were
married
i
warned
you
that
i
had
not
good
wifely
qualities
you
mock
me
to
say
that
now
on
that
point
at
least
the
only
noble
course
would
be
to
hold
your
tongue
for
you
are
still
queen
of
me
eustacia
though
i
may
no
longer
be
king
of
you
you
are
my
husband
does
not
that
content
you
not
unless
you
are
my
wife
without
regret
i
cannot
answer
you
i
remember
saying
that
i
should
be
a
serious
matter
on
your
hands
yes
i
saw
that
then
you
were
too
quick
to
see
no
true
lover
would
have
seen
any
such
thing
you
are
too
severe
upon
me
clym
i
won
t
like
your
speaking
so
at
all
well
i
married
you
in
spite
of
it
and
don
t
regret
doing
so
how
cold
you
seem
this
afternoon
and
yet
i
used
to
think
there
never
was
a
warmer
heart
than
yours
yes
i
fear
we
are
cooling
i
see
it
as
well
as
you
she
sighed
mournfully
and
how
madly
we
loved
two
months
ago
you
were
never
tired
of
contemplating
me
nor
i
of
contemplating
you
who
could
have
thought
then
that
by
this
time
my
eyes
would
not
seem
so
very
bright
to
yours
nor
your
lips
so
very
sweet
to
mine
two
months
is
it
possible
yes
tis
too
true
you
sigh
dear
as
if
you
were
sorry
for
it
and
that
s
a
hopeful
sign
no
i
don
t
sigh
for
that
there
are
other
things
for
me
to
sigh
for
or
any
other
woman
in
my
place
that
your
chances
in
life
are
ruined
by
marrying
in
haste
an
unfortunate
man
why
will
you
force
me
clym
to
say
bitter
things
i
deserve
pity
as
much
as
you
as
much
i
think
i
deserve
it
more
for
you
can
sing
it
would
be
a
strange
hour
which
should
catch
me
singing
under
such
a
cloud
as
this
believe
me
sweet
i
could
weep
to
a
degree
that
would
astonish
and
confound
such
an
elastic
mind
as
yours
even
had
you
felt
careless
about
your
own
affliction
you
might
have
refrained
from
singing
out
of
sheer
pity
for
mine
god
if
i
were
a
man
in
such
a
position
i
would
curse
rather
than
sing
yeobright
placed
his
hand
upon
her
arm
now
don
t
you
suppose
my
inexperienced
girl
that
i
cannot
rebel
in
high
promethean
fashion
against
the
gods
and
fate
as
well
as
you
i
have
felt
more
steam
and
smoke
of
that
sort
than
you
have
ever
heard
of
but
the
more
i
see
of
life
the
more
do
i
perceive
that
there
is
nothing
particularly
great
in
its
greatest
walks
and
therefore
nothing
particularly
small
in
mine
of
furze
cutting
if
i
feel
that
the
greatest
blessings
vouchsafed
to
us
are
not
very
valuable
how
can
i
feel
it
to
be
any
great
hardship
when
they
are
taken
away
so
i
sing
to
pass
the
time
have
you
indeed
lost
all
tenderness
for
me
that
you
begrudge
me
a
few
cheerful
moments
i
have
still
some
tenderness
left
for
you
your
words
have
no
longer
their
old
flavour
and
so
love
dies
with
good
fortune
i
cannot
listen
to
this
clym
it
will
end
bitterly
she
said
in
a
broken
voice
i
will
go
home
she
goes
out
to
battle
against
depression
a
few
days
later
before
the
month
of
august
has
expired
eustacia
and
yeobright
sat
together
at
their
early
dinner
eustacia
s
manner
had
become
of
late
almost
apathetic
there
was
a
forlorn
look
about
her
beautiful
eyes
which
whether
she
deserved
it
or
not
would
have
excited
pity
in
the
breast
of
anyone
who
had
known
her
during
the
full
flush
of
her
love
for
clym
the
feelings
of
husband
and
wife
varied
in
some
measure
inversely
with
their
positions
clym
the
afflicted
man
was
cheerful
and
he
even
tried
to
comfort
her
who
had
never
felt
a
moment
of
physical
suffering
in
her
whole
life
come
brighten
up
dearest
we
shall
be
all
right
again
some
day
perhaps
i
shall
see
as
well
as
ever
and
i
solemnly
promise
that
i
ll
leave
off
cutting
furze
as
soon
as
i
have
the
power
to
do
anything
better
you
cannot
seriously
wish
me
to
stay
idling
at
home
all
day
but
it
is
so
dreadful
a
furze
cutter
and
you
a
man
who
have
lived
about
the
world
and
speak
french
and
german
and
who
are
fit
for
what
is
so
much
better
than
this
i
suppose
when
you
first
saw
me
and
heard
about
me
i
was
wrapped
in
a
sort
of
golden
halo
to
your
eyes
a
man
who
knew
glorious
things
and
had
mixed
in
brilliant
scenes
in
short
an
adorable
delightful
distracting
hero
yes
she
said
sobbing
and
now
i
am
a
poor
fellow
in
brown
leather
don
t
taunt
me
but
enough
of
this
i
will
not
be
depressed
any
more
i
am
going
from
home
this
afternoon
unless
you
greatly
object
there
is
to
be
a
village
picnic
a
gipsying
they
call
it
at
east
egdon
and
i
shall
go
to
dance
why
not
you
can
sing
well
well
as
you
will
must
i
come
to
fetch
you
if
you
return
soon
enough
from
your
work
but
do
not
inconvenience
yourself
about
it
i
know
the
way
home
and
the
heath
has
no
terror
for
me
and
can
you
cling
to
gaiety
so
eagerly
as
to
walk
all
the
way
to
a
village
festival
in
search
of
it
now
you
don
t
like
my
going
alone
clym
you
are
not
jealous
no
but
i
would
come
with
you
if
it
could
give
you
any
pleasure
though
as
things
stand
perhaps
you
have
too
much
of
me
already
still
i
somehow
wish
that
you
did
not
want
to
go
yes
perhaps
i
am
jealous
and
who
could
be
jealous
with
more
reason
than
i
a
half
blind
man
over
such
a
woman
as
you
don
t
think
like
it
let
me
go
and
don
t
take
all
my
spirits
away
i
would
rather
lose
all
my
own
my
sweet
wife
go
and
do
whatever
you
like
who
can
forbid
your
indulgence
in
any
whim
you
have
all
my
heart
yet
i
believe
and
because
you
bear
with
me
who
am
in
truth
a
drag
upon
you
i
owe
you
thanks
yes
go
alone
and
shine
as
for
me
i
will
stick
to
my
doom
at
that
kind
of
meeting
people
would
shun
me
my
hook
and
gloves
are
like
the
st
lazarus
rattle
of
the
leper
warning
the
world
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
a
sight
that
would
sadden
them
he
kissed
her
put
on
his
leggings
and
went
out
when
he
was
gone
she
rested
her
head
upon
her
hands
and
said
to
herself
two
wasted
lives
his
and
mine
and
i
am
come
to
this
will
it
drive
me
out
of
my
mind
she
cast
about
for
any
possible
course
which
offered
the
least
improvement
on
the
existing
state
of
things
and
could
find
none
she
imagined
how
all
those
budmouth
ones
who
should
learn
what
had
become
of
her
would
say
look
at
the
girl
for
whom
nobody
was
good
enough
to
eustacia
the
situation
seemed
such
a
mockery
of
her
hopes
that
death
appeared
the
only
door
of
relief
if
the
satire
of
heaven
should
go
much
further
suddenly
she
aroused
herself
and
exclaimed
but
i
ll
shake
it
off
yes
i
will
shake
it
off
no
one
shall
know
my
suffering
i
ll
be
bitterly
merry
and
ironically
gay
and
i
ll
laugh
in
derision
and
i
ll
begin
by
going
to
this
dance
on
the
green
she
ascended
to
her
bedroom
and
dressed
herself
with
scrupulous
care
to
an
onlooker
her
beauty
would
have
made
her
feelings
almost
seem
reasonable
the
gloomy
corner
into
which
accident
as
much
as
indiscretion
had
brought
this
woman
might
have
led
even
a
moderate
partisan
to
feel
that
she
had
cogent
reasons
for
asking
the
supreme
power
by
what
right
a
being
of
such
exquisite
finish
had
been
placed
in
circumstances
calculated
to
make
of
her
charms
a
curse
rather
than
a
blessing
it
was
five
in
the
afternoon
when
she
came
out
from
the
house
ready
for
her
walk
there
was
material
enough
in
the
picture
for
twenty
new
conquests
the
rebellious
sadness
that
was
rather
too
apparent
when
she
sat
indoors
without
a
bonnet
was
cloaked
and
softened
by
her
outdoor
attire
which
always
had
a
sort
of
nebulousness
about
it
devoid
of
harsh
edges
anywhere
so
that
her
face
looked
from
its
environment
as
from
a
cloud
with
no
noticeable
lines
of
demarcation
between
flesh
and
clothes
the
heat
of
the
day
had
scarcely
declined
as
yet
and
she
went
along
the
sunny
hills
at
a
leisurely
pace
there
being
ample
time
for
her
idle
expedition
tall
ferns
buried
her
in
their
leafage
whenever
her
path
lay
through
them
which
now
formed
miniature
forests
though
not
one
stem
of
them
would
remain
to
bud
the
next
year
the
site
chosen
for
the
village
festivity
was
one
of
the
lawnlike
oases
which
were
occasionally
yet
not
often
met
with
on
the
plateaux
of
the
heath
district
the
brakes
of
furze
and
fern
terminated
abruptly
round
the
margin
and
the
grass
was
unbroken
a
green
cattletrack
skirted
the
spot
without
however
emerging
from
the
screen
of
fern
and
this
path
eustacia
followed
in
order
to
reconnoitre
the
group
before
joining
it
the
lusty
notes
of
the
east
egdon
band
had
directed
her
unerringly
and
she
now
beheld
the
musicians
themselves
sitting
in
a
blue
wagon
with
red
wheels
scrubbed
as
bright
as
new
and
arched
with
sticks
to
which
boughs
and
flowers
were
tied
in
front
of
this
was
the
grand
central
dance
of
fifteen
or
twenty
couples
flanked
by
minor
dances
of
inferior
individuals
whose
gyrations
were
not
always
in
strict
keeping
with
the
tune
the
young
men
wore
blue
and
white
rosettes
and
with
a
flush
on
their
faces
footed
it
to
the
girls
who
with
the
excitement
and
the
exercise
blushed
deeper
than
the
pink
of
their
numerous
ribbons
fair
ones
with
long
curls
fair
ones
with
short
curls
fair
ones
with
lovelocks
fair
ones
with
braids
flew
round
and
round
and
a
beholder
might
well
have
wondered
how
such
a
prepossessing
set
of
young
women
of
like
size
age
and
disposition
could
have
been
collected
together
where
there
were
only
one
or
two
villages
to
choose
from
in
the
background
was
one
happy
man
dancing
by
himself
with
closed
eyes
totally
oblivious
of
all
the
rest
a
fire
was
burning
under
a
pollard
thorn
a
few
paces
off
over
which
three
kettles
hung
in
a
row
hard
by
was
a
table
where
elderly
dames
prepared
tea
but
eustacia
looked
among
them
in
vain
for
the
cattle
dealer
s
wife
who
had
suggested
that
she
should
come
and
had
promised
to
obtain
a
courteous
welcome
for
her
this
unexpected
absence
of
the
only
local
resident
whom
eustacia
knew
considerably
damaged
her
scheme
for
an
afternoon
of
reckless
gaiety
joining
in
became
a
matter
of
difficulty
notwithstanding
that
were
she
to
advance
cheerful
dames
would
come
forward
with
cups
of
tea
and
make
much
of
her
as
a
stranger
of
superior
grace
and
knowledge
to
themselves
having
watched
the
company
through
the
figures
of
two
dances
she
decided
to
walk
a
little
further
to
a
cottage
where
she
might
get
some
refreshment
and
then
return
homeward
in
the
shady
time
of
evening
this
she
did
and
by
the
time
that
she
retraced
her
steps
towards
the
scene
of
the
gipsying
which
it
was
necessary
to
repass
on
her
way
to
alderworth
the
sun
was
going
down
the
air
was
now
so
still
that
she
could
hear
the
band
afar
off
and
it
seemed
to
be
playing
with
more
spirit
if
that
were
possible
than
when
she
had
come
away
on
reaching
the
hill
the
sun
had
quite
disappeared
but
this
made
little
difference
either
to
eustacia
or
to
the
revellers
for
a
round
yellow
moon
was
rising
before
her
though
its
rays
had
not
yet
outmastered
those
from
the
west
the
dance
was
going
on
just
the
same
but
strangers
had
arrived
and
formed
a
ring
around
the
figure
so
that
eustacia
could
stand
among
these
without
a
chance
of
being
recognized
a
whole
village
full
of
sensuous
emotion
scattered
abroad
all
the
year
long
surged
here
in
a
focus
for
an
hour
the
forty
hearts
of
those
waving
couples
were
beating
as
they
had
not
done
since
twelve
months
before
they
had
come
together
in
similar
jollity
for
the
time
paganism
was
revived
in
their
hearts
the
pride
of
life
was
all
in
all
and
they
adored
none
other
than
themselves
how
many
of
those
impassioned
but
temporary
embraces
were
destined
to
become
perpetual
was
possibly
the
wonder
of
some
of
those
who
indulged
in
them
as
well
as
of
eustacia
who
looked
on
she
began
to
envy
those
pirouetters
to
hunger
for
the
hope
and
happiness
which
the
fascination
of
the
dance
seemed
to
engender
within
them
desperately
fond
of
dancing
herself
one
of
eustacia
s
expectations
of
paris
had
been
the
opportunity
it
might
afford
her
of
indulgence
in
this
favourite
pastime
unhappily
that
expectation
was
now
extinct
within
her
for
ever
whilst
she
abstractedly
watched
them
spinning
and
fluctuating
in
the
increasing
moonlight
she
suddenly
heard
her
name
whispered
by
a
voice
over
her
shoulder
turning
in
surprise
she
beheld
at
her
elbow
one
whose
presence
instantly
caused
her
to
flush
to
the
temples
it
was
wildeve
till
this
moment
he
had
not
met
her
eye
since
the
morning
of
his
marriage
when
she
had
been
loitering
in
the
church
and
had
startled
him
by
lifting
her
veil
and
coming
forward
to
sign
the
register
as
witness
yet
why
the
sight
of
him
should
have
instigated
that
sudden
rush
of
blood
she
could
not
tell
before
she
could
speak
he
whispered
do
you
like
dancing
as
much
as
ever
i
think
i
do
she
replied
in
a
low
voice
will
you
dance
with
me
it
would
be
a
great
change
for
me
but
will
it
not
seem
strange
what
strangeness
can
there
be
in
relations
dancing
together
ah
yes
relations
perhaps
none
still
if
you
don
t
like
to
be
seen
pull
down
your
veil
though
there
is
not
much
risk
of
being
known
by
this
light
lots
of
strangers
are
here
she
did
as
he
suggested
and
the
act
was
a
tacit
acknowledgment
that
she
accepted
his
offer
wildeve
gave
her
his
arm
and
took
her
down
on
the
outside
of
the
ring
to
the
bottom
of
the
dance
which
they
entered
in
two
minutes
more
they
were
involved
in
the
figure
and
began
working
their
way
upwards
to
the
top
till
they
had
advanced
halfway
thither
eustacia
wished
more
than
once
that
she
had
not
yielded
to
his
request
from
the
middle
to
the
top
she
felt
that
since
she
had
come
out
to
seek
pleasure
she
was
only
doing
a
natural
thing
to
obtain
it
fairly
launched
into
the
ceaseless
glides
and
whirls
which
their
new
position
as
top
couple
opened
up
to
them
eustacia
s
pulses
began
to
move
too
quickly
for
long
rumination
of
any
kind
through
the
length
of
five
and
twenty
couples
they
threaded
their
giddy
way
and
a
new
vitality
entered
her
form
the
pale
ray
of
evening
lent
a
fascination
to
the
experience
there
is
a
certain
degree
and
tone
of
light
which
tends
to
disturb
the
equilibrium
of
the
senses
and
to
promote
dangerously
the
tenderer
moods
added
to
movement
it
drives
the
emotions
to
rankness
the
reason
becoming
sleepy
and
unperceiving
in
inverse
proportion
and
this
light
fell
now
upon
these
two
from
the
disc
of
the
moon
all
the
dancing
girls
felt
the
symptoms
but
eustacia
most
of
all
the
grass
under
their
feet
became
trodden
away
and
the
hard
beaten
surface
of
the
sod
when
viewed
aslant
towards
the
moonlight
shone
like
a
polished
table
the
air
became
quite
still
the
flag
above
the
wagon
which
held
the
musicians
clung
to
the
pole
and
the
players
appeared
only
in
outline
against
the
sky
except
when
the
circular
mouths
of
the
trombone
ophicleide
and
french
horn
gleamed
out
like
huge
eyes
from
the
shade
of
their
figures
the
pretty
dresses
of
the
maids
lost
their
subtler
day
colours
and
showed
more
or
less
of
a
misty
white
eustacia
floated
round
and
round
on
wildeve
s
arm
her
face
rapt
and
statuesque
her
soul
had
passed
away
from
and
forgotten
her
features
which
were
left
empty
and
quiescent
as
they
always
are
when
feeling
goes
beyond
their
register
how
near
she
was
to
wildeve
it
was
terrible
to
think
of
she
could
feel
his
breathing
and
he
of
course
could
feel
hers
how
badly
she
had
treated
him
yet
here
they
were
treading
one
measure
the
enchantment
of
the
dance
surprised
her
a
clear
line
of
difference
divided
like
a
tangible
fence
her
experience
within
this
maze
of
motion
from
her
experience
without
it
her
beginning
to
dance
had
been
like
a
change
of
atmosphere
outside
she
had
been
steeped
in
arctic
frigidity
by
comparison
with
the
tropical
sensations
here
she
had
entered
the
dance
from
the
troubled
hours
of
her
late
life
as
one
might
enter
a
brilliant
chamber
after
a
night
walk
in
a
wood
wildeve
by
himself
would
have
been
merely
an
agitation
wildeve
added
to
the
dance
and
the
moonlight
and
the
secrecy
began
to
be
a
delight
whether
his
personality
supplied
the
greater
part
of
this
sweetly
compounded
feeling
or
whether
the
dance
and
the
scene
weighed
the
more
therein
was
a
nice
point
upon
which
eustacia
herself
was
entirely
in
a
cloud
people
began
to
say
who
are
they
but
no
invidious
inquiries
were
made
had
eustacia
mingled
with
the
other
girls
in
their
ordinary
daily
walks
the
case
would
have
been
different
here
she
was
not
inconvenienced
by
excessive
inspection
for
all
were
wrought
to
their
brightest
grace
by
the
occasion
like
the
planet
mercury
surrounded
by
the
lustre
of
sunset
her
permanent
brilliancy
passed
without
much
notice
in
the
temporary
glory
of
the
situation
as
for
wildeve
his
feelings
are
easy
to
guess
obstacles
were
a
ripening
sun
to
his
love
and
he
was
at
this
moment
in
a
delirium
of
exquisite
misery
to
clasp
as
his
for
five
minutes
what
was
another
man
s
through
all
the
rest
of
the
year
was
a
kind
of
thing
he
of
all
men
could
appreciate
he
had
long
since
begun
to
sigh
again
for
eustacia
indeed
it
may
be
asserted
that
signing
the
marriage
register
with
thomasin
was
the
natural
signal
to
his
heart
to
return
to
its
first
quarters
and
that
the
extra
complication
of
eustacia
s
marriage
was
the
one
addition
required
to
make
that
return
compulsory
thus
for
different
reasons
what
was
to
the
rest
an
exhilarating
movement
was
to
these
two
a
riding
upon
the
whirlwind
the
dance
had
come
like
an
irresistible
attack
upon
whatever
sense
of
social
order
there
was
in
their
minds
to
drive
them
back
into
old
paths
which
were
now
doubly
irregular
through
three
dances
in
succession
they
spun
their
way
and
then
fatigued
with
the
incessant
motion
eustacia
turned
to
quit
the
circle
in
which
she
had
already
remained
too
long
wildeve
led
her
to
a
grassy
mound
a
few
yards
distant
where
she
sat
down
her
partner
standing
beside
her
from
the
time
that
he
addressed
her
at
the
beginning
of
the
dance
till
now
they
had
not
exchanged
a
word
the
dance
and
the
walking
have
tired
you
he
said
tenderly
no
not
greatly
it
is
strange
that
we
should
have
met
here
of
all
places
after
missing
each
other
so
long
we
have
missed
because
we
tried
to
miss
i
suppose
yes
but
you
began
that
proceeding
by
breaking
a
promise
it
is
scarcely
worth
while
to
talk
of
that
now
we
have
formed
other
ties
since
then
you
no
less
than
i
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
your
husband
is
ill
he
is
not
ill
only
incapacitated
yes
that
is
what
i
mean
i
sincerely
sympathize
with
you
in
your
trouble
fate
has
treated
you
cruelly
she
was
silent
awhile
have
you
heard
that
he
has
chosen
to
work
as
a
furze
cutter
she
said
in
a
low
mournful
voice
it
has
been
mentioned
to
me
answered
wildeve
hesitatingly
but
i
hardly
believed
it
it
is
true
what
do
you
think
of
me
as
a
furze
cutter
s
wife
i
think
the
same
as
ever
of
you
eustacia
nothing
of
that
sort
can
degrade
you
you
ennoble
the
occupation
of
your
husband
i
wish
i
could
feel
it
is
there
any
chance
of
mr
yeobright
getting
better
he
thinks
so
i
doubt
it
i
was
quite
surprised
to
hear
that
he
had
taken
a
cottage
i
thought
in
common
with
other
people
that
he
would
have
taken
you
off
to
a
home
in
paris
immediately
after
you
had
married
him
what
a
gay
bright
future
she
has
before
her
i
thought
he
will
i
suppose
return
there
with
you
if
his
sight
gets
strong
again
observing
that
she
did
not
reply
he
regarded
her
more
closely
she
was
almost
weeping
images
of
a
future
never
to
be
enjoyed
the
revived
sense
of
her
bitter
disappointment
the
picture
of
the
neighbour
s
suspended
ridicule
which
was
raised
by
wildeve
s
words
had
been
too
much
for
proud
eustacia
s
equanimity
wildeve
could
hardly
control
his
own
too
forward
feelings
when
he
saw
her
silent
perturbation
but
he
affected
not
to
notice
this
and
she
soon
recovered
her
calmness
you
do
not
intend
to
walk
home
by
yourself
he
asked
o
yes
said
eustacia
what
could
hurt
me
on
this
heath
who
have
nothing
by
diverging
a
little
i
can
make
my
way
home
the
same
as
yours
i
shall
be
glad
to
keep
you
company
as
far
as
throope
corner
seeing
that
eustacia
sat
on
in
hesitation
he
added
perhaps
you
think
it
unwise
to
be
seen
in
the
same
road
with
me
after
the
events
of
last
summer
indeed
i
think
no
such
thing
she
said
haughtily
i
shall
accept
whose
company
i
choose
for
all
that
may
be
said
by
the
miserable
inhabitants
of
egdon
then
let
us
walk
on
if
you
are
ready
our
nearest
way
is
towards
that
holly
bush
with
the
dark
shadow
that
you
see
down
there
eustacia
arose
and
walked
beside
him
in
the
direction
signified
brushing
her
way
over
the
damping
heath
and
fern
and
followed
by
the
strains
of
the
merrymakers
who
still
kept
up
the
dance
the
moon
had
now
waxed
bright
and
silvery
but
the
heath
was
proof
against
such
illumination
and
there
was
to
be
observed
the
striking
scene
of
a
dark
rayless
tract
of
country
under
an
atmosphere
charged
from
its
zenith
to
its
extremities
with
whitest
light
to
an
eye
above
them
their
two
faces
would
have
appeared
amid
the
expanse
like
two
pearls
on
a
table
of
ebony
on
this
account
the
irregularities
of
the
path
were
not
visible
and
wildeve
occasionally
stumbled
whilst
eustacia
found
it
necessary
to
perform
some
graceful
feats
of
balancing
whenever
a
small
tuft
of
heather
or
root
of
furze
protruded
itself
through
the
grass
of
the
narrow
track
and
entangled
her
feet
at
these
junctures
in
her
progress
a
hand
was
invariably
stretched
forward
to
steady
her
holding
her
firmly
until
smooth
ground
was
again
reached
when
the
hand
was
again
withdrawn
to
a
respectful
distance
they
performed
the
journey
for
the
most
part
in
silence
and
drew
near
to
throope
corner
a
few
hundred
yards
from
which
a
short
path
branched
away
to
eustacia
s
house
by
degrees
they
discerned
coming
towards
them
a
pair
of
human
figures
apparently
of
the
male
sex
when
they
came
a
little
nearer
eustacia
broke
the
silence
by
saying
one
of
those
men
is
my
husband
he
promised
to
come
to
meet
me
and
the
other
is
my
greatest
enemy
said
wildeve
it
looks
like
diggory
venn
that
is
the
man
it
is
an
awkward
meeting
said
she
but
such
is
my
fortune
he
knows
too
much
about
me
unless
he
could
know
more
and
so
prove
to
himself
that
what
he
now
knows
counts
for
nothing
well
let
it
be
you
must
deliver
me
up
to
them
you
will
think
twice
before
you
direct
me
to
do
that
here
is
a
man
who
has
not
forgotten
an
item
in
our
meetings
at
rainbarrow
he
is
in
company
with
your
husband
which
of
them
seeing
us
together
here
will
believe
that
our
meeting
and
dancing
at
the
gipsy
party
was
by
chance
very
well
she
whispered
gloomily
leave
me
before
they
come
up
wildeve
bade
her
a
tender
farewell
and
plunged
across
the
fern
and
furze
eustacia
slowly
walking
on
in
two
or
three
minutes
she
met
her
husband
and
his
companion
my
journey
ends
here
for
tonight
reddleman
said
yeobright
as
soon
as
he
perceived
her
i
turn
back
with
this
lady
good
night
good
night
mr
yeobright
said
venn
i
hope
to
see
you
better
soon
the
moonlight
shone
directly
upon
venn
s
face
as
he
spoke
and
revealed
all
its
lines
to
eustacia
he
was
looking
suspiciously
at
her
that
venn
s
keen
eye
had
discerned
what
yeobright
s
feeble
vision
had
not
a
man
in
the
act
of
withdrawing
from
eustacia
s
side
was
within
the
limits
of
the
probable
if
eustacia
had
been
able
to
follow
the
reddleman
she
would
soon
have
found
striking
confirmation
of
her
thought
no
sooner
had
clym
given
her
his
arm
and
led
her
off
the
scene
than
the
reddleman
turned
back
from
the
beaten
track
towards
east
egdon
whither
he
had
been
strolling
merely
to
accompany
clym
in
his
walk
diggory
s
van
being
again
in
the
neighbourhood
stretching
out
his
long
legs
he
crossed
the
pathless
portion
of
the
heath
somewhat
in
the
direction
which
wildeve
had
taken
only
a
man
accustomed
to
nocturnal
rambles
could
at
this
hour
have
descended
those
shaggy
slopes
with
venn
s
velocity
without
falling
headlong
into
a
pit
or
snapping
off
his
leg
by
jamming
his
foot
into
some
rabbit
burrow
but
venn
went
on
without
much
inconvenience
to
himself
and
the
course
of
his
scamper
was
towards
the
quiet
woman
inn
this
place
he
reached
in
about
half
an
hour
and
he
was
well
aware
that
no
person
who
had
been
near
throope
corner
when
he
started
could
have
got
down
here
before
him
the
lonely
inn
was
not
yet
closed
though
scarcely
an
individual
was
there
the
business
done
being
chiefly
with
travellers
who
passed
the
inn
on
long
journeys
and
these
had
now
gone
on
their
way
venn
went
to
the
public
room
called
for
a
mug
of
ale
and
inquired
of
the
maid
in
an
indifferent
tone
if
mr
wildeve
was
at
home
thomasin
sat
in
an
inner
room
and
heard
venn
s
voice
when
customers
were
present
she
seldom
showed
herself
owing
to
her
inherent
dislike
for
the
business
but
perceiving
that
no
one
else
was
there
tonight
she
came
out
he
is
not
at
home
yet
diggory
she
said
pleasantly
but
i
expected
him
sooner
he
has
been
to
east
egdon
to
buy
a
horse
did
he
wear
a
light
wideawake
yes
then
i
saw
him
at
throope
corner
leading
one
home
said
venn
drily
a
beauty
with
a
white
face
and
a
mane
as
black
as
night
he
will
soon
be
here
no
doubt
rising
and
looking
for
a
moment
at
the
pure
sweet
face
of
thomasin
over
which
a
shadow
of
sadness
had
passed
since
the
time
when
he
had
last
seen
her
he
ventured
to
add
mr
wildeve
seems
to
be
often
away
at
this
time
o
yes
cried
thomasin
in
what
was
intended
to
be
a
tone
of
gaiety
husbands
will
play
the
truant
you
know
i
wish
you
could
tell
me
of
some
secret
plan
that
would
help
me
to
keep
him
home
at
my
will
in
the
evenings
i
will
consider
if
i
know
of
one
replied
venn
in
that
same
light
tone
which
meant
no
lightness
and
then
he
bowed
in
a
manner
of
his
own
invention
and
moved
to
go
thomasin
offered
him
her
hand
and
without
a
sigh
though
with
food
for
many
the
reddleman
went
out
when
wildeve
returned
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
thomasin
said
simply
and
in
the
abashed
manner
usual
with
her
now
where
is
the
horse
damon
o
i
have
not
bought
it
after
all
the
man
asks
too
much
but
somebody
saw
you
at
throope
corner
leading
it
home
a
beauty
with
a
white
face
and
a
mane
as
black
as
night
ah
said
wildeve
fixing
his
eyes
upon
her
who
told
you
that
venn
the
reddleman
the
expression
of
wildeve
s
face
became
curiously
condensed
that
is
a
mistake
it
must
have
been
someone
else
he
said
slowly
and
testily
for
he
perceived
that
venn
s
countermoves
had
begun
again
rough
coercion
is
employed
those
words
of
thomasin
which
seemed
so
little
but
meant
so
much
remained
in
the
ears
of
diggory
venn
help
me
to
keep
him
home
in
the
evenings
on
this
occasion
venn
had
arrived
on
egdon
heath
only
to
cross
to
the
other
side
he
had
no
further
connection
with
the
interests
of
the
yeobright
family
and
he
had
a
business
of
his
own
to
attend
to
yet
he
suddenly
began
to
feel
himself
drifting
into
the
old
track
of
manoeuvring
on
thomasin
s
account
he
sat
in
his
van
and
considered
from
thomasin
s
words
and
manner
he
had
plainly
gathered
that
wildeve
neglected
her
for
whom
could
he
neglect
her
if
not
for
eustacia
yet
it
was
scarcely
credible
that
things
had
come
to
such
a
head
as
to
indicate
that
eustacia
systematically
encouraged
him
venn
resolved
to
reconnoitre
somewhat
carefully
the
lonely
road
which
led
along
the
vale
from
wildeve
s
dwelling
to
clym
s
house
at
alderworth
at
this
time
as
has
been
seen
wildeve
was
quite
innocent
of
any
predetermined
act
of
intrigue
and
except
at
the
dance
on
the
green
he
had
not
once
met
eustacia
since
her
marriage
but
that
the
spirit
of
intrigue
was
in
him
had
been
shown
by
a
recent
romantic
habit
of
his
a
habit
of
going
out
after
dark
and
strolling
towards
alderworth
there
looking
at
the
moon
and
stars
looking
at
eustacia
s
house
and
walking
back
at
leisure
accordingly
when
watching
on
the
night
after
the
festival
the
reddleman
saw
him
ascend
by
the
little
path
lean
over
the
front
gate
of
clym
s
garden
sigh
and
turn
to
go
back
again
it
was
plain
that
wildeve
s
intrigue
was
rather
ideal
than
real
venn
retreated
before
him
down
the
hill
to
a
place
where
the
path
was
merely
a
deep
groove
between
the
heather
here
he
mysteriously
bent
over
the
ground
for
a
few
minutes
and
retired
when
wildeve
came
on
to
that
spot
his
ankle
was
caught
by
something
and
he
fell
headlong
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
the
power
of
respiration
he
sat
up
and
listened
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
gloom
beyond
the
spiritless
stir
of
the
summer
wind
feeling
about
for
the
obstacle
which
had
flung
him
down
he
discovered
that
two
tufts
of
heath
had
been
tied
together
across
the
path
forming
a
loop
which
to
a
traveller
was
certain
overthrow
wildeve
pulled
off
the
string
that
bound
them
and
went
on
with
tolerable
quickness
on
reaching
home
he
found
the
cord
to
be
of
a
reddish
colour
it
was
just
what
he
had
expected
although
his
weaknesses
were
not
specially
those
akin
to
physical
fear
this
species
of
coup
de
jarnac
from
one
he
knew
too
well
troubled
the
mind
of
wildeve
but
his
movements
were
unaltered
thereby
a
night
or
two
later
he
again
went
along
the
vale
to
alderworth
taking
the
precaution
of
keeping
out
of
any
path
the
sense
that
he
was
watched
that
craft
was
employed
to
circumvent
his
errant
tastes
added
piquancy
to
a
journey
so
entirely
sentimental
so
long
as
the
danger
was
of
no
fearful
sort
he
imagined
that
venn
and
mrs
yeobright
were
in
league
and
felt
that
there
was
a
certain
legitimacy
in
combating
such
a
coalition
the
heath
tonight
appeared
to
be
totally
deserted
and
wildeve
after
looking
over
eustacia
s
garden
gate
for
some
little
time
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
was
tempted
by
the
fascination
that
emotional
smuggling
had
for
his
nature
to
advance
towards
the
window
which
was
not
quite
closed
the
blind
being
only
partly
drawn
down
he
could
see
into
the
room
and
eustacia
was
sitting
there
alone
wildeve
contemplated
her
for
a
minute
and
then
retreating
into
the
heath
beat
the
ferns
lightly
whereupon
moths
flew
out
alarmed
securing
one
he
returned
to
the
window
and
holding
the
moth
to
the
chink
opened
his
hand
the
moth
made
towards
the
candle
upon
eustacia
s
table
hovered
round
it
two
or
three
times
and
flew
into
the
flame
eustacia
started
up
this
had
been
a
well
known
signal
in
old
times
when
wildeve
had
used
to
come
secretly
wooing
to
mistover
she
at
once
knew
that
wildeve
was
outside
but
before
she
could
consider
what
to
do
her
husband
came
in
from
upstairs
eustacia
s
face
burnt
crimson
at
the
unexpected
collision
of
incidents
and
filled
it
with
an
animation
that
it
too
frequently
lacked
you
have
a
very
high
colour
dearest
said
yeobright
when
he
came
close
enough
to
see
it
your
appearance
would
be
no
worse
if
it
were
always
so
i
am
warm
said
eustacia
i
think
i
will
go
into
the
air
for
a
few
minutes
shall
i
go
with
you
o
no
i
am
only
going
to
the
gate
she
arose
but
before
she
had
time
to
get
out
of
the
room
a
loud
rapping
began
upon
the
front
door
i
ll
go
i
ll
go
said
eustacia
in
an
unusually
quick
tone
for
her
and
she
glanced
eagerly
towards
the
window
whence
the
moth
had
flown
but
nothing
appeared
there
you
had
better
not
at
this
time
of
the
evening
he
said
clym
stepped
before
her
into
the
passage
and
eustacia
waited
her
somnolent
manner
covering
her
inner
heat
and
agitation
she
listened
and
clym
opened
the
door
no
words
were
uttered
outside
and
presently
he
closed
it
and
came
back
saying
nobody
was
there
i
wonder
what
that
could
have
meant
he
was
left
to
wonder
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
for
no
explanation
offered
itself
and
eustacia
said
nothing
the
additional
fact
that
she
knew
of
only
adding
more
mystery
to
the
performance
meanwhile
a
little
drama
had
been
acted
outside
which
saved
eustacia
from
all
possibility
of
compromising
herself
that
evening
at
least
whilst
wildeve
had
been
preparing
his
moth
signal
another
person
had
come
behind
him
up
to
the
gate
this
man
who
carried
a
gun
in
his
hand
looked
on
for
a
moment
at
the
other
s
operation
by
the
window
walked
up
to
the
house
knocked
at
the
door
and
then
vanished
round
the
corner
and
over
the
hedge
damn
him
said
wildeve
he
has
been
watching
me
again
as
his
signal
had
been
rendered
futile
by
this
uproarious
rapping
wildeve
withdrew
passed
out
at
the
gate
and
walked
quickly
down
the
path
without
thinking
of
anything
except
getting
away
unnoticed
halfway
down
the
hill
the
path
ran
near
a
knot
of
stunted
hollies
which
in
the
general
darkness
of
the
scene
stood
as
the
pupil
in
a
black
eye
when
wildeve
reached
this
point
a
report
startled
his
ear
and
a
few
spent
gunshots
fell
among
the
leaves
around
him
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
himself
was
the
cause
of
that
gun
s
discharge
and
he
rushed
into
the
clump
of
hollies
beating
the
bushes
furiously
with
his
stick
but
nobody
was
there
this
attack
was
a
more
serious
matter
than
the
last
and
it
was
some
time
before
wildeve
recovered
his
equanimity
a
new
and
most
unpleasant
system
of
menace
had
begun
and
the
intent
appeared
to
be
to
do
him
grievous
bodily
harm
wildeve
had
looked
upon
venn
s
first
attempt
as
a
species
of
horseplay
which
the
reddleman
had
indulged
in
for
want
of
knowing
better
but
now
the
boundary
line
was
passed
which
divides
the
annoying
from
the
perilous
had
wildeve
known
how
thoroughly
in
earnest
venn
had
become
he
might
have
been
still
more
alarmed
the
reddleman
had
been
almost
exasperated
by
the
sight
of
wildeve
outside
clym
s
house
and
he
was
prepared
to
go
to
any
lengths
short
of
absolutely
shooting
him
to
terrify
the
young
innkeeper
out
of
his
recalcitrant
impulses
the
doubtful
legitimacy
of
such
rough
coercion
did
not
disturb
the
mind
of
venn
it
troubles
few
such
minds
in
such
cases
and
sometimes
this
is
not
to
be
regretted
from
the
impeachment
of
strafford
to
farmer
lynch
s
short
way
with
the
scamps
of
virginia
there
have
been
many
triumphs
of
justice
which
are
mockeries
of
law
about
half
a
mile
below
clym
s
secluded
dwelling
lay
a
hamlet
where
lived
one
of
the
two
constables
who
preserved
the
peace
in
the
parish
of
alderworth
and
wildeve
went
straight
to
the
constable
s
cottage
almost
the
first
thing
that
he
saw
on
opening
the
door
was
the
constable
s
truncheon
hanging
to
a
nail
as
if
to
assure
him
that
here
were
the
means
to
his
purpose
on
inquiry
however
of
the
constable
s
wife
he
learnt
that
the
constable
was
not
at
home
wildeve
said
he
would
wait
the
minutes
ticked
on
and
the
constable
did
not
arrive
wildeve
cooled
down
from
his
state
of
high
indignation
to
a
restless
dissatisfaction
with
himself
the
scene
the
constable
s
wife
and
the
whole
set
of
circumstances
he
arose
and
left
the
house
altogether
the
experience
of
that
evening
had
had
a
cooling
not
to
say
a
chilling
effect
on
misdirected
tenderness
and
wildeve
was
in
no
mood
to
ramble
again
to
alderworth
after
nightfall
in
hope
of
a
stray
glance
from
eustacia
thus
far
the
reddleman
had
been
tolerably
successful
in
his
rude
contrivances
for
keeping
down
wildeve
s
inclination
to
rove
in
the
evening
he
had
nipped
in
the
bud
the
possible
meeting
between
eustacia
and
her
old
lover
this
very
night
but
he
had
not
anticipated
that
the
tendency
of
his
action
would
be
to
divert
wildeve
s
movement
rather
than
to
stop
it
the
gambling
with
the
guineas
had
not
conduced
to
make
him
a
welcome
guest
to
clym
but
to
call
upon
his
wife
s
relative
was
natural
and
he
was
determined
to
see
eustacia
it
was
necessary
to
choose
some
less
untoward
hour
than
ten
o
clock
at
night
since
it
is
unsafe
to
go
in
the
evening
he
said
i
ll
go
by
day
meanwhile
venn
had
left
the
heath
and
gone
to
call
upon
mrs
yeobright
with
whom
he
had
been
on
friendly
terms
since
she
had
learnt
what
a
providential
countermove
he
had
made
towards
the
restitution
of
the
family
guineas
she
wondered
at
the
lateness
of
his
call
but
had
no
objection
to
see
him
he
gave
her
a
full
account
of
clym
s
affliction
and
of
the
state
in
which
he
was
living
then
referring
to
thomasin
touched
gently
upon
the
apparent
sadness
of
her
days
now
ma
am
depend
upon
it
he
said
you
couldn
t
do
a
better
thing
for
either
of
em
than
to
make
yourself
at
home
in
their
houses
even
if
there
should
be
a
little
rebuff
at
first
both
she
and
my
son
disobeyed
me
in
marrying
therefore
i
have
no
interest
in
their
households
their
troubles
are
of
their
own
making
mrs
yeobright
tried
to
speak
severely
but
the
account
of
her
son
s
state
had
moved
her
more
than
she
cared
to
show
your
visits
would
make
wildeve
walk
straighter
than
he
is
inclined
to
do
and
might
prevent
unhappiness
down
the
heath
what
do
you
mean
i
saw
something
tonight
out
there
which
i
didn
t
like
at
all
i
wish
your
son
s
house
and
mr
wildeve
s
were
a
hundred
miles
apart
instead
of
four
or
five
then
there
was
an
understanding
between
him
and
clym
s
wife
when
he
made
a
fool
of
thomasin
we
ll
hope
there
s
no
understanding
now
and
our
hope
will
probably
be
very
vain
o
clym
o
thomasin
there
s
no
harm
done
yet
in
fact
i
ve
persuaded
wildeve
to
mind
his
own
business
how
o
not
by
talking
by
a
plan
of
mine
called
the
silent
system
i
hope
you
ll
succeed
i
shall
if
you
help
me
by
calling
and
making
friends
with
your
son
you
ll
have
a
chance
then
of
using
your
eyes
well
since
it
has
come
to
this
said
mrs
yeobright
sadly
i
will
own
to
you
reddleman
that
i
thought
of
going
i
should
be
much
happier
if
we
were
reconciled
the
marriage
is
unalterable
my
life
may
be
cut
short
and
i
should
wish
to
die
in
peace
he
is
my
only
son
and
since
sons
are
made
of
such
stuff
i
am
not
sorry
i
have
no
other
as
for
thomasin
i
never
expected
much
from
her
and
she
has
not
disappointed
me
but
i
forgave
her
long
ago
and
i
forgive
him
now
i
ll
go
at
this
very
time
of
the
reddleman
s
conversation
with
mrs
yeobright
at
blooms
end
another
conversation
on
the
same
subject
was
languidly
proceeding
at
alderworth
all
the
day
clym
had
borne
himself
as
if
his
mind
were
too
full
of
its
own
matter
to
allow
him
to
care
about
outward
things
and
his
words
now
showed
what
had
occupied
his
thoughts
it
was
just
after
the
mysterious
knocking
that
he
began
the
theme
since
i
have
been
away
today
eustacia
i
have
considered
that
something
must
be
done
to
heal
up
this
ghastly
breach
between
my
dear
mother
and
myself
it
troubles
me
what
do
you
propose
to
do
said
eustacia
abstractedly
for
she
could
not
clear
away
from
her
the
excitement
caused
by
wildeve
s
recent
manoeuvre
for
an
interview
you
seem
to
take
a
very
mild
interest
in
what
i
propose
little
or
much
said
clym
with
tolerable
warmth
you
mistake
me
she
answered
reviving
at
his
reproach
i
am
only
thinking
what
of
partly
of
that
moth
whose
skeleton
is
getting
burnt
up
in
the
wick
of
the
candle
she
said
slowly
but
you
know
i
always
take
an
interest
in
what
you
say
very
well
dear
then
i
think
i
must
go
and
call
upon
her
he
went
on
with
tender
feeling
it
is
a
thing
i
am
not
at
all
too
proud
to
do
and
only
a
fear
that
i
might
irritate
her
has
kept
me
away
so
long
but
i
must
do
something
it
is
wrong
in
me
to
allow
this
sort
of
thing
to
go
on
what
have
you
to
blame
yourself
about
she
is
getting
old
and
her
life
is
lonely
and
i
am
her
only
son
she
has
thomasin
thomasin
is
not
her
daughter
and
if
she
were
that
would
not
excuse
me
but
this
is
beside
the
point
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
go
to
her
and
all
i
wish
to
ask
you
is
whether
you
will
do
your
best
to
help
me
that
is
forget
the
past
and
if
she
shows
her
willingness
to
be
reconciled
meet
her
halfway
by
welcoming
her
to
our
house
or
by
accepting
a
welcome
to
hers
at
first
eustacia
closed
her
lips
as
if
she
would
rather
do
anything
on
the
whole
globe
than
what
he
suggested
but
the
lines
of
her
mouth
softened
with
thought
though
not
so
far
as
they
might
have
softened
and
she
said
i
will
put
nothing
in
your
way
but
after
what
has
passed
it
is
asking
too
much
that
i
go
and
make
advances
you
never
distinctly
told
me
what
did
pass
between
you
i
could
not
do
it
then
nor
can
i
now
sometimes
more
bitterness
is
sown
in
five
minutes
than
can
be
got
rid
of
in
a
whole
life
and
that
may
be
the
case
here
she
paused
a
few
moments
and
added
if
you
had
never
returned
to
your
native
place
clym
what
a
blessing
it
would
have
been
for
you
it
has
altered
the
destinies
of
three
people
five
eustacia
thought
but
she
kept
that
in
the
journey
across
the
heath
thursday
the
thirty
first
of
august
was
one
of
a
series
of
days
during
which
snug
houses
were
stifling
and
when
cool
draughts
were
treats
when
cracks
appeared
in
clayey
gardens
and
were
called
earthquakes
by
apprehensive
children
when
loose
spokes
were
discovered
in
the
wheels
of
carts
and
carriages
and
when
stinging
insects
haunted
the
air
the
earth
and
every
drop
of
water
that
was
to
be
found
in
mrs
yeobright
s
garden
large
leaved
plants
of
a
tender
kind
flagged
by
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
rhubarb
bent
downward
at
eleven
and
even
stiff
cabbages
were
limp
by
noon
it
was
about
eleven
o
clock
on
this
day
that
mrs
yeobright
started
across
the
heath
towards
her
son
s
house
to
do
her
best
in
getting
reconciled
with
him
and
eustacia
in
conformity
with
her
words
to
the
reddleman
she
had
hoped
to
be
well
advanced
in
her
walk
before
the
heat
of
the
day
was
at
its
highest
but
after
setting
out
she
found
that
this
was
not
to
be
done
the
sun
had
branded
the
whole
heath
with
its
mark
even
the
purple
heath
flowers
having
put
on
a
brownness
under
the
dry
blazes
of
the
few
preceding
days
every
valley
was
filled
with
air
like
that
of
a
kiln
and
the
clean
quartz
sand
of
the
winter
water
courses
which
formed
summer
paths
had
undergone
a
species
of
incineration
since
the
drought
had
set
in
in
cool
fresh
weather
mrs
yeobright
would
have
found
no
inconvenience
in
walking
to
alderworth
but
the
present
torrid
attack
made
the
journey
a
heavy
undertaking
for
a
woman
past
middle
age
and
at
the
end
of
the
third
mile
she
wished
that
she
had
hired
fairway
to
drive
her
a
portion
at
least
of
the
distance
but
from
the
point
at
which
she
had
arrived
it
was
as
easy
to
reach
clym
s
house
as
to
get
home
again
so
she
went
on
the
air
around
her
pulsating
silently
and
oppressing
the
earth
with
lassitude
she
looked
at
the
sky
overhead
and
saw
that
the
sapphirine
hue
of
the
zenith
in
spring
and
early
summer
had
been
replaced
by
a
metallic
violet
occasionally
she
came
to
a
spot
where
independent
worlds
of
ephemerons
were
passing
their
time
in
mad
carousal
some
in
the
air
some
on
the
hot
ground
and
vegetation
some
in
the
tepid
and
stringy
water
of
a
nearly
dried
pool
all
the
shallower
ponds
had
decreased
to
a
vaporous
mud
amid
which
the
maggoty
shapes
of
innumerable
obscure
creatures
could
be
indistinctly
seen
heaving
and
wallowing
with
enjoyment
being
a
woman
not
disinclined
to
philosophize
she
sometimes
sat
down
under
her
umbrella
to
rest
and
to
watch
their
happiness
for
a
certain
hopefulness
as
to
the
result
of
her
visit
gave
ease
to
her
mind
and
between
important
thoughts
left
it
free
to
dwell
on
any
infinitesimal
matter
which
caught
her
eyes
mrs
yeobright
had
never
before
been
to
her
son
s
house
and
its
exact
position
was
unknown
to
her
she
tried
one
ascending
path
and
another
and
found
that
they
led
her
astray
retracing
her
steps
she
came
again
to
an
open
level
where
she
perceived
at
a
distance
a
man
at
work
she
went
towards
him
and
inquired
the
way
the
labourer
pointed
out
the
direction
and
added
do
you
see
that
furze
cutter
ma
am
going
up
that
footpath
yond
mrs
yeobright
strained
her
eyes
and
at
last
said
that
she
did
perceive
him
well
if
you
follow
him
you
can
make
no
mistake
he
s
going
to
the
same
place
ma
am
she
followed
the
figure
indicated
he
appeared
of
a
russet
hue
not
more
distinguishable
from
the
scene
around
him
than
the
green
caterpillar
from
the
leaf
it
feeds
on
his
progress
when
actually
walking
was
more
rapid
than
mrs
yeobright
s
but
she
was
enabled
to
keep
at
an
equable
distance
from
him
by
his
habit
of
stopping
whenever
he
came
to
a
brake
of
brambles
where
he
paused
awhile
on
coming
in
her
turn
to
each
of
these
spots
she
found
half
a
dozen
long
limp
brambles
which
he
had
cut
from
the
bush
during
his
halt
and
laid
out
straight
beside
the
path
they
were
evidently
intended
for
furze
faggot
bonds
which
he
meant
to
collect
on
his
return
the
silent
being
who
thus
occupied
himself
seemed
to
be
of
no
more
account
in
life
than
an
insect
he
appeared
as
a
mere
parasite
of
the
heath
fretting
its
surface
in
his
daily
labour
as
a
moth
frets
a
garment
entirely
engrossed
with
its
products
having
no
knowledge
of
anything
in
the
world
but
fern
furze
heath
lichens
and
moss
the
furze
cutter
was
so
absorbed
in
the
business
of
his
journey
that
he
never
turned
his
head
and
his
leather
legged
and
gauntleted
form
at
length
became
to
her
as
nothing
more
than
a
moving
handpost
to
show
her
the
way
suddenly
she
was
attracted
to
his
individuality
by
observing
peculiarities
in
his
walk
it
was
a
gait
she
had
seen
somewhere
before
and
the
gait
revealed
the
man
to
her
as
the
gait
of
ahimaaz
in
the
distant
plain
made
him
known
to
the
watchman
of
the
king
his
walk
is
exactly
as
my
husband
s
used
to
be
she
said
and
then
the
thought
burst
upon
her
that
the
furze
cutter
was
her
son
she
was
scarcely
able
to
familiarize
herself
with
this
strange
reality
she
had
been
told
that
clym
was
in
the
habit
of
cutting
furze
but
she
had
supposed
that
he
occupied
himself
with
the
labour
only
at
odd
times
by
way
of
useful
pastime
yet
she
now
beheld
him
as
a
furze
cutter
and
nothing
more
wearing
the
regulation
dress
of
the
craft
and
thinking
the
regulation
thoughts
to
judge
by
his
motions
planning
a
dozen
hasty
schemes
for
at
once
preserving
him
and
eustacia
from
this
mode
of
life
she
throbbingly
followed
the
way
and
saw
him
enter
his
own
door
at
one
side
of
clym
s
house
was
a
knoll
and
on
the
top
of
the
knoll
a
clump
of
fir
trees
so
highly
thrust
up
into
the
sky
that
their
foliage
from
a
distance
appeared
as
a
black
spot
in
the
air
above
the
crown
of
the
hill
on
reaching
this
place
mrs
yeobright
felt
distressingly
agitated
weary
and
unwell
she
ascended
and
sat
down
under
their
shade
to
recover
herself
and
to
consider
how
best
to
break
the
ground
with
eustacia
so
as
not
to
irritate
a
woman
underneath
whose
apparent
indolence
lurked
passions
even
stronger
and
more
active
than
her
own
the
trees
beneath
which
she
sat
were
singularly
battered
rude
and
wild
and
for
a
few
minutes
mrs
yeobright
dismissed
thoughts
of
her
own
storm
broken
and
exhausted
state
to
contemplate
theirs
not
a
bough
in
the
nine
trees
which
composed
the
group
but
was
splintered
lopped
and
distorted
by
the
fierce
weather
that
there
held
them
at
its
mercy
whenever
it
prevailed
some
were
blasted
and
split
as
if
by
lightning
black
stains
as
from
fire
marking
their
sides
while
the
ground
at
their
feet
was
strewn
with
dead
fir
needles
and
heaps
of
cones
blown
down
in
the
gales
of
past
years
the
place
was
called
the
devil
s
bellows
and
it
was
only
necessary
to
come
there
on
a
march
or
november
night
to
discover
the
forcible
reasons
for
that
name
on
the
present
heated
afternoon
when
no
perceptible
wind
was
blowing
the
trees
kept
up
a
perpetual
moan
which
one
could
hardly
believe
to
be
caused
by
the
air
here
she
sat
for
twenty
minutes
or
more
ere
she
could
summon
resolution
to
go
down
to
the
door
her
courage
being
lowered
to
zero
by
her
physical
lassitude
to
any
other
person
than
a
mother
it
might
have
seemed
a
little
humiliating
that
she
the
elder
of
the
two
women
should
be
the
first
to
make
advances
but
mrs
yeobright
had
well
considered
all
that
and
she
only
thought
how
best
to
make
her
visit
appear
to
eustacia
not
abject
but
wise
from
her
elevated
position
the
exhausted
woman
could
perceive
the
roof
of
the
house
below
and
the
garden
and
the
whole
enclosure
of
the
little
domicile
and
now
at
the
moment
of
rising
she
saw
a
second
man
approaching
the
gate
his
manner
was
peculiar
hesitating
and
not
that
of
a
person
come
on
business
or
by
invitation
he
surveyed
the
house
with
interest
and
then
walked
round
and
scanned
the
outer
boundary
of
the
garden
as
one
might
have
done
had
it
been
the
birthplace
of
shakespeare
the
prison
of
mary
stuart
or
the
chateau
of
hougomont
after
passing
round
and
again
reaching
the
gate
he
went
in
mrs
yeobright
was
vexed
at
this
having
reckoned
on
finding
her
son
and
his
wife
by
themselves
but
a
moment
s
thought
showed
her
that
the
presence
of
an
acquaintance
would
take
off
the
awkwardness
of
her
first
appearance
in
the
house
by
confining
the
talk
to
general
matters
until
she
had
begun
to
feel
comfortable
with
them
she
came
down
the
hill
to
the
gate
and
looked
into
the
hot
garden
there
lay
the
cat
asleep
on
the
bare
gravel
of
the
path
as
if
beds
rugs
and
carpets
were
unendurable
the
leaves
of
the
hollyhocks
hung
like
half
closed
umbrellas
the
sap
almost
simmered
in
the
stems
and
foliage
with
a
smooth
surface
glared
like
metallic
mirrors
a
small
apple
tree
of
the
sort
called
ratheripe
grew
just
inside
the
gate
the
only
one
which
throve
in
the
garden
by
reason
of
the
lightness
of
the
soil
and
among
the
fallen
apples
on
the
ground
beneath
were
wasps
rolling
drunk
with
the
juice
or
creeping
about
the
little
caves
in
each
fruit
which
they
had
eaten
out
before
stupefied
by
its
sweetness
by
the
door
lay
clym
s
furze
hook
and
the
last
handful
of
faggot
bonds
she
had
seen
him
gather
they
had
plainly
been
thrown
down
there
as
he
entered
the
house
a
conjuncture
and
its
result
upon
the
pedestrian
wildeve
as
has
been
stated
was
determined
to
visit
eustacia
boldly
by
day
and
on
the
easy
terms
of
a
relation
since
the
reddleman
had
spied
out
and
spoilt
his
walks
to
her
by
night
the
spell
that
she
had
thrown
over
him
in
the
moonlight
dance
made
it
impossible
for
a
man
having
no
strong
puritanic
force
within
him
to
keep
away
altogether
he
merely
calculated
on
meeting
her
and
her
husband
in
an
ordinary
manner
chatting
a
little
while
and
leaving
again
every
outward
sign
was
to
be
conventional
but
the
one
great
fact
would
be
there
to
satisfy
him
he
would
see
her
he
did
not
even
desire
clym
s
absence
since
it
was
just
possible
that
eustacia
might
resent
any
situation
which
could
compromise
her
dignity
as
a
wife
whatever
the
state
of
her
heart
towards
him
women
were
often
so
he
went
accordingly
and
it
happened
that
the
time
of
his
arrival
coincided
with
that
of
mrs
yeobright
s
pause
on
the
hill
near
the
house
when
he
had
looked
round
the
premises
in
the
manner
she
had
noticed
he
went
and
knocked
at
the
door
there
was
a
few
minutes
interval
and
then
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
the
door
opened
and
eustacia
herself
confronted
him
nobody
could
have
imagined
from
her
bearing
now
that
here
stood
the
woman
who
had
joined
with
him
in
the
impassioned
dance
of
the
week
before
unless
indeed
he
could
have
penetrated
below
the
surface
and
gauged
the
real
depth
of
that
still
stream
i
hope
you
reached
home
safely
said
wildeve
o
yes
she
carelessly
returned
and
were
you
not
tired
the
next
day
i
feared
you
might
be
i
was
rather
you
need
not
speak
low
nobody
will
over
hear
us
my
small
servant
is
gone
on
an
errand
to
the
village
then
clym
is
not
at
home
yes
he
is
o
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
had
locked
the
door
because
you
were
alone
and
were
afraid
of
tramps
no
here
is
my
husband
they
had
been
standing
in
the
entry
closing
the
front
door
and
turning
the
key
as
before
she
threw
open
the
door
of
the
adjoining
room
and
asked
him
to
walk
in
wildeve
entered
the
room
appearing
to
be
empty
but
as
soon
as
he
had
advanced
a
few
steps
he
started
on
the
hearthrug
lay
clym
asleep
beside
him
were
the
leggings
thick
boots
leather
gloves
and
sleeve
waistcoat
in
which
he
worked
you
may
go
in
you
will
not
disturb
him
she
said
following
behind
my
reason
for
fastening
the
door
is
that
he
may
not
be
intruded
upon
by
any
chance
comer
while
lying
here
if
i
should
be
in
the
garden
or
upstairs
why
is
he
sleeping
there
said
wildeve
in
low
tones
he
is
very
weary
he
went
out
at
half
past
four
this
morning
and
has
been
working
ever
since
he
cuts
furze
because
it
is
the
only
thing
he
can
do
that
does
not
put
any
strain
upon
his
poor
eyes
the
contrast
between
the
sleeper
s
appearance
and
wildeve
s
at
this
moment
was
painfully
apparent
to
eustacia
wildeve
being
elegantly
dressed
in
a
new
summer
suit
and
light
hat
and
she
continued
ah
you
don
t
know
how
differently
he
appeared
when
i
first
met
him
though
it
is
such
a
little
while
ago
his
hands
were
as
white
and
soft
as
mine
and
look
at
them
now
how
rough
and
brown
they
are
his
complexion
is
by
nature
fair
and
that
rusty
look
he
has
now
all
of
a
colour
with
his
leather
clothes
is
caused
by
the
burning
of
the
sun
why
does
he
go
out
at
all
wildeve
whispered
because
he
hates
to
be
idle
though
what
he
earns
doesn
t
add
much
to
our
exchequer
however
he
says
that
when
people
are
living
upon
their
capital
they
must
keep
down
current
expenses
by
turning
a
penny
where
they
can
the
fates
have
not
been
kind
to
you
eustacia
yeobright
i
have
nothing
to
thank
them
for
nor
has
he
except
for
their
one
great
gift
to
him
what
s
that
wildeve
looked
her
in
the
eyes
eustacia
blushed
for
the
first
time
that
day
well
i
am
a
questionable
gift
she
said
quietly
i
thought
you
meant
the
gift
of
content
which
he
has
and
i
have
not
i
can
understand
content
in
such
a
case
though
how
the
outward
situation
can
attract
him
puzzles
me
that
s
because
you
don
t
know
him
he
s
an
enthusiast
about
ideas
and
careless
about
outward
things
he
often
reminds
me
of
the
apostle
paul
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
he
s
so
grand
in
character
as
that
yes
but
the
worst
of
it
is
that
though
paul
was
excellent
as
a
man
in
the
bible
he
would
hardly
have
done
in
real
life
their
voices
had
instinctively
dropped
lower
though
at
first
they
had
taken
no
particular
care
to
avoid
awakening
clym
well
if
that
means
that
your
marriage
is
a
misfortune
to
you
you
know
who
is
to
blame
said
wildeve
the
marriage
is
no
misfortune
in
itself
she
retorted
with
some
little
petulance
it
is
simply
the
accident
which
has
happened
since
that
has
been
the
cause
of
my
ruin
i
have
certainly
got
thistles
for
figs
in
a
worldly
sense
but
how
could
i
tell
what
time
would
bring
forth
sometimes
eustacia
i
think
it
is
a
judgment
upon
you
you
rightly
belonged
to
me
you
know
and
i
had
no
idea
of
losing
you
no
it
was
not
my
fault
two
could
not
belong
to
you
and
remember
that
before
i
was
aware
you
turned
aside
to
another
woman
it
was
cruel
levity
in
you
to
do
that
i
never
dreamt
of
playing
such
a
game
on
my
side
till
you
began
it
on
yours
i
meant
nothing
by
it
replied
wildeve
it
was
a
mere
interlude
men
are
given
to
the
trick
of
having
a
passing
fancy
for
somebody
else
in
the
midst
of
a
permanent
love
which
reasserts
itself
afterwards
just
as
before
on
account
of
your
rebellious
manner
to
me
i
was
tempted
to
go
further
than
i
should
have
done
and
when
you
still
would
keep
playing
the
same
tantalizing
part
i
went
further
still
and
married
her
turning
and
looking
again
at
the
unconscious
form
of
clym
he
murmured
i
am
afraid
that
you
don
t
value
your
prize
clym
he
ought
to
be
happier
than
i
in
one
thing
at
least
he
may
know
what
it
is
to
come
down
in
the
world
and
to
be
afflicted
with
a
great
personal
calamity
but
he
probably
doesn
t
know
what
it
is
to
lose
the
woman
he
loved
he
is
not
ungrateful
for
winning
her
whispered
eustacia
and
in
that
respect
he
is
a
good
man
many
women
would
go
far
for
such
a
husband
but
do
i
desire
unreasonably
much
in
wanting
what
is
called
life
music
poetry
passion
war
and
all
the
beating
and
pulsing
that
are
going
on
in
the
great
arteries
of
the
world
that
was
the
shape
of
my
youthful
dream
but
i
did
not
get
it
yet
i
thought
i
saw
the
way
to
it
in
my
clym
and
you
only
married
him
on
that
account
there
you
mistake
me
i
married
him
because
i
loved
him
but
i
won
t
say
that
i
didn
t
love
him
partly
because
i
thought
i
saw
a
promise
of
that
life
in
him
you
have
dropped
into
your
old
mournful
key
but
i
am
not
going
to
be
depressed
she
cried
perversely
i
began
a
new
system
by
going
to
that
dance
and
i
mean
to
stick
to
it
clym
can
sing
merrily
why
should
not
i
wildeve
looked
thoughtfully
at
her
it
is
easier
to
say
you
will
sing
than
to
do
it
though
if
i
could
i
would
encourage
you
in
your
attempt
but
as
life
means
nothing
to
me
without
one
thing
which
is
now
impossible
you
will
forgive
me
for
not
being
able
to
encourage
you
damon
what
is
the
matter
with
you
that
you
speak
like
that
she
asked
raising
her
deep
shady
eyes
to
his
that
s
a
thing
i
shall
never
tell
plainly
and
perhaps
if
i
try
to
tell
you
in
riddles
you
will
not
care
to
guess
them
eustacia
remained
silent
for
a
minute
and
she
said
we
are
in
a
strange
relationship
today
you
mince
matters
to
an
uncommon
nicety
you
mean
damon
that
you
still
love
me
well
that
gives
me
sorrow
for
i
am
not
made
so
entirely
happy
by
my
marriage
that
i
am
willing
to
spurn
you
for
the
information
as
i
ought
to
do
but
we
have
said
too
much
about
this
do
you
mean
to
wait
until
my
husband
is
awake
i
thought
to
speak
to
him
but
it
is
unnecessary
eustacia
if
i
offend
you
by
not
forgetting
you
you
are
right
to
mention
it
but
do
not
talk
of
spurning
she
did
not
reply
and
they
stood
looking
musingly
at
clym
as
he
slept
on
in
that
profound
sleep
which
is
the
result
of
physical
labour
carried
on
in
circumstances
that
wake
no
nervous
fear
god
how
i
envy
him
that
sweet
sleep
said
wildeve
i
have
not
slept
like
that
since
i
was
a
boy
years
and
years
ago
while
they
thus
watched
him
a
click
at
the
gate
was
audible
and
a
knock
came
to
the
door
eustacia
went
to
a
window
and
looked
out
her
countenance
changed
first
she
became
crimson
and
then
the
red
subsided
till
it
even
partially
left
her
lips
shall
i
go
away
said
wildeve
standing
up
i
hardly
know
who
is
it
mrs
yeobright
o
what
she
said
to
me
that
day
i
cannot
understand
this
visit
what
does
she
mean
and
she
suspects
that
past
time
of
ours
i
am
in
your
hands
if
you
think
she
had
better
not
see
me
here
i
ll
go
into
the
next
room
well
yes
go
wildeve
at
once
withdrew
but
before
he
had
been
half
a
minute
in
the
adjoining
apartment
eustacia
came
after
him
no
she
said
we
won
t
have
any
of
this
if
she
comes
in
she
must
see
you
and
think
if
she
likes
there
s
something
wrong
but
how
can
i
open
the
door
to
her
when
she
dislikes
me
wishes
to
see
not
me
but
her
son
i
won
t
open
the
door
mrs
yeobright
knocked
again
more
loudly
her
knocking
will
in
all
likelihood
awaken
him
continued
eustacia
and
then
he
will
let
her
in
himself
ah
listen
they
could
hear
clym
moving
in
the
other
room
as
if
disturbed
by
the
knocking
and
he
uttered
the
word
mother
yes
he
is
awake
he
will
go
to
the
door
she
said
with
a
breath
of
relief
come
this
way
i
have
a
bad
name
with
her
and
you
must
not
be
seen
thus
i
am
obliged
to
act
by
stealth
not
because
i
do
ill
but
because
others
are
pleased
to
say
so
by
this
time
she
had
taken
him
to
the
back
door
which
was
open
disclosing
a
path
leading
down
the
garden
now
one
word
damon
she
remarked
as
he
stepped
forth
this
is
your
first
visit
here
let
it
be
your
last
we
have
been
hot
lovers
in
our
time
but
it
won
t
do
now
good
bye
good
bye
said
wildeve
i
have
had
all
i
came
for
and
i
am
satisfied
what
was
it
a
sight
of
you
upon
my
eternal
honour
i
came
for
no
more
wildeve
kissed
his
hand
to
the
beautiful
girl
he
addressed
and
passed
into
the
garden
where
she
watched
him
down
the
path
over
the
stile
at
the
end
and
into
the
ferns
outside
which
brushed
his
hips
as
he
went
along
till
he
became
lost
in
their
thickets
when
he
had
quite
gone
she
slowly
turned
and
directed
her
attention
to
the
interior
of
the
house
but
it
was
possible
that
her
presence
might
not
be
desired
by
clym
and
his
mother
at
this
moment
of
their
first
meeting
or
that
it
would
be
superfluous
at
all
events
she
was
in
no
hurry
to
meet
mrs
yeobright
she
resolved
to
wait
till
clym
came
to
look
for
her
and
glided
back
into
the
garden
here
she
idly
occupied
herself
for
a
few
minutes
till
finding
no
notice
was
taken
of
her
she
retraced
her
steps
through
the
house
to
the
front
where
she
listened
for
voices
in
the
parlour
but
hearing
none
she
opened
the
door
and
went
in
to
her
astonishment
clym
lay
precisely
as
wildeve
and
herself
had
left
him
his
sleep
apparently
unbroken
he
had
been
disturbed
and
made
to
dream
and
murmur
by
the
knocking
but
he
had
not
awakened
eustacia
hastened
to
the
door
and
in
spite
of
her
reluctance
to
open
it
to
a
woman
who
had
spoken
of
her
so
bitterly
she
unfastened
it
and
looked
out
nobody
was
to
be
seen
there
by
the
scraper
lay
clym
s
hook
and
the
handful
of
faggot
bonds
he
had
brought
home
in
front
of
her
were
the
empty
path
the
garden
gate
standing
slightly
ajar
and
beyond
the
great
valley
of
purple
heath
thrilling
silently
in
the
sun
mrs
yeobright
was
gone
clym
s
mother
was
at
this
time
following
a
path
which
lay
hidden
from
eustacia
by
a
shoulder
of
the
hill
her
walk
thither
from
the
garden
gate
had
been
hasty
and
determined
as
of
a
woman
who
was
now
no
less
anxious
to
escape
from
the
scene
than
she
had
previously
been
to
enter
it
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
ground
within
her
two
sights
were
graven
that
of
clym
s
hook
and
brambles
at
the
door
and
that
of
a
woman
s
face
at
a
window
her
lips
trembled
becoming
unnaturally
thin
as
she
murmured
tis
too
much
clym
how
can
he
bear
to
do
it
he
is
at
home
and
yet
he
lets
her
shut
the
door
against
me
in
her
anxiety
to
get
out
of
the
direct
view
of
the
house
she
had
diverged
from
the
straightest
path
homeward
and
while
looking
about
to
regain
it
she
came
upon
a
little
boy
gathering
whortleberries
in
a
hollow
the
boy
was
johnny
nunsuch
who
had
been
eustacia
s
stoker
at
the
bonfire
and
with
the
tendency
of
a
minute
body
to
gravitate
towards
a
greater
he
began
hovering
round
mrs
yeobright
as
soon
as
she
appeared
and
trotted
on
beside
her
without
perceptible
consciousness
of
his
act
mrs
yeobright
spoke
to
him
as
one
in
a
mesmeric
sleep
tis
a
long
way
home
my
child
and
we
shall
not
get
there
till
evening
i
shall
said
her
small
companion
i
am
going
to
play
marnels
afore
supper
and
we
go
to
supper
at
six
o
clock
because
father
comes
home
does
your
father
come
home
at
six
too
no
he
never
comes
nor
my
son
either
nor
anybody
what
have
made
you
so
down
have
you
seen
a
ooser
i
have
seen
what
s
worse
a
woman
s
face
looking
at
me
through
a
windowpane
is
that
a
bad
sight
yes
it
is
always
a
bad
sight
to
see
a
woman
looking
out
at
a
weary
wayfarer
and
not
letting
her
in
once
when
i
went
to
throope
great
pond
to
catch
effets
i
seed
myself
looking
up
at
myself
and
i
was
frightened
and
jumped
back
like
anything
if
they
had
only
shown
signs
of
meeting
my
advances
halfway
how
well
it
might
have
been
done
but
there
is
no
chance
shut
out
she
must
have
set
him
against
me
can
there
be
beautiful
bodies
without
hearts
inside
i
think
so
i
would
not
have
done
it
against
a
neighbour
s
cat
on
such
a
fiery
day
as
this
what
is
it
you
say
never
again
never
not
even
if
they
send
for
me
you
must
be
a
very
curious
woman
to
talk
like
that
o
no
not
at
all
she
said
returning
to
the
boy
s
prattle
most
people
who
grow
up
and
have
children
talk
as
i
do
when
you
grow
up
your
mother
will
talk
as
i
do
too
i
hope
she
won
t
because
tis
very
bad
to
talk
nonsense
yes
child
it
is
nonsense
i
suppose
are
you
not
nearly
spent
with
the
heat
yes
but
not
so
much
as
you
be
how
do
you
know
your
face
is
white
and
wet
and
your
head
is
hanging
down
like
ah
i
am
exhausted
from
inside
why
do
you
every
time
you
take
a
step
go
like
this
the
child
in
speaking
gave
to
his
motion
the
jerk
and
limp
of
an
invalid
because
i
have
a
burden
which
is
more
than
i
can
bear
the
little
boy
remained
silently
pondering
and
they
tottered
on
side
by
side
until
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
elapsed
when
mrs
yeobright
whose
weakness
plainly
increased
said
to
him
i
must
sit
down
here
to
rest
when
she
had
seated
herself
he
looked
long
in
her
face
and
said
how
funny
you
draw
your
breath
like
a
lamb
when
you
drive
him
till
he
s
nearly
done
for
do
you
always
draw
your
breath
like
that
not
always
her
voice
was
now
so
low
as
to
be
scarcely
above
a
whisper
you
will
go
to
sleep
there
i
suppose
won
t
you
you
have
shut
your
eyes
already
no
i
shall
not
sleep
much
till
another
day
and
then
i
hope
to
have
a
long
long
one
very
long
now
can
you
tell
me
if
rimsmoor
pond
is
dry
this
summer
rimsmoor
pond
is
but
oker
s
pool
isn
t
because
he
is
deep
and
is
never
dry
tis
just
over
there
is
the
water
clear
yes
middling
except
where
the
heath
croppers
walk
into
it
then
take
this
and
go
as
fast
as
you
can
and
dip
me
up
the
clearest
you
can
find
i
am
very
faint
she
drew
from
the
small
willow
reticule
that
she
carried
in
her
hand
an
old
fashioned
china
teacup
without
a
handle
it
was
one
of
half
a
dozen
of
the
same
sort
lying
in
the
reticule
which
she
had
preserved
ever
since
her
childhood
and
had
brought
with
her
today
as
a
small
present
for
clym
and
eustacia
the
boy
started
on
his
errand
and
soon
came
back
with
the
water
such
as
it
was
mrs
yeobright
attempted
to
drink
but
it
was
so
warm
as
to
give
her
nausea
and
she
threw
it
away
afterwards
she
still
remained
sitting
with
her
eyes
closed
the
boy
waited
played
near
her
caught
several
of
the
little
brown
butterflies
which
abounded
and
then
said
as
he
waited
again
i
like
going
on
better
than
biding
still
will
you
soon
start
again
i
don
t
know
i
wish
i
might
go
on
by
myself
he
resumed
fearing
apparently
that
he
was
to
be
pressed
into
some
unpleasant
service
do
you
want
me
any
more
please
mrs
yeobright
made
no
reply
what
shall
i
tell
mother
the
boy
continued
tell
her
you
have
seen
a
broken
hearted
woman
cast
off
by
her
son
before
quite
leaving
her
he
threw
upon
her
face
a
wistful
glance
as
if
he
had
misgivings
on
the
generosity
of
forsaking
her
thus
he
gazed
into
her
face
in
a
vague
wondering
manner
like
that
of
one
examining
some
strange
old
manuscript
the
key
to
whose
characters
is
undiscoverable
he
was
not
so
young
as
to
be
absolutely
without
a
sense
that
sympathy
was
demanded
he
was
not
old
enough
to
be
free
from
the
terror
felt
in
childhood
at
beholding
misery
in
adult
quarters
hither
to
deemed
impregnable
and
whether
she
were
in
a
position
to
cause
trouble
or
to
suffer
from
it
whether
she
and
her
affliction
were
something
to
pity
or
something
to
fear
it
was
beyond
him
to
decide
he
lowered
his
eyes
and
went
on
without
another
word
before
he
had
gone
half
a
mile
he
had
forgotten
all
about
her
except
that
she
was
a
woman
who
had
sat
down
to
rest
mrs
yeobright
s
exertions
physical
and
emotional
had
well
nigh
prostrated
her
but
she
continued
to
creep
along
in
short
stages
with
long
breaks
between
the
sun
had
now
got
far
to
the
west
of
south
and
stood
directly
in
her
face
like
some
merciless
incendiary
brand
in
hand
waiting
to
consume
her
with
the
departure
of
the
boy
all
visible
animation
disappeared
from
the
landscape
though
the
intermittent
husky
notes
of
the
male
grasshoppers
from
every
tuft
of
furze
were
enough
to
show
that
amid
the
prostration
of
the
larger
animal
species
an
unseen
insect
world
was
busy
in
all
the
fullness
of
life
in
two
hours
she
reached
a
slope
about
three
fourths
the
whole
distance
from
alderworth
to
her
own
home
where
a
little
patch
of
shepherd
s
thyme
intruded
upon
the
path
and
she
sat
down
upon
the
perfumed
mat
it
formed
there
in
front
of
her
a
colony
of
ants
had
established
a
thoroughfare
across
the
way
where
they
toiled
a
never
ending
and
heavy
laden
throng
to
look
down
upon
them
was
like
observing
a
city
street
from
the
top
of
a
tower
she
remembered
that
this
bustle
of
ants
had
been
in
progress
for
years
at
the
same
spot
doubtless
those
of
the
old
times
were
the
ancestors
of
these
which
walked
there
now
she
leant
back
to
obtain
more
thorough
rest
and
the
soft
eastern
portion
of
the
sky
was
as
great
a
relief
to
her
eyes
as
the
thyme
was
to
her
head
while
she
looked
a
heron
arose
on
that
side
of
the
sky
and
flew
on
with
his
face
towards
the
sun
he
had
come
dripping
wet
from
some
pool
in
the
valleys
and
as
he
flew
the
edges
and
lining
of
his
wings
his
thighs
and
his
breast
were
so
caught
by
the
bright
sunbeams
that
he
appeared
as
if
formed
of
burnished
silver
up
in
the
zenith
where
he
was
seemed
a
free
and
happy
place
away
from
all
contact
with
the
earthly
ball
to
which
she
was
pinioned
and
she
wished
that
she
could
arise
uncrushed
from
its
surface
and
fly
as
he
flew
then
but
being
a
mother
it
was
inevitable
that
she
should
soon
cease
to
ruminate
upon
her
own
condition
had
the
track
of
her
next
thought
been
marked
by
a
streak
in
the
air
like
the
path
of
a
meteor
it
would
have
shown
a
direction
contrary
to
the
heron
s
and
have
descended
to
the
eastward
upon
the
roof
of
clym
s
house
the
tragic
meeting
of
two
old
friends
he
in
the
meantime
had
aroused
himself
from
sleep
sat
up
and
looked
around
eustacia
was
sitting
in
a
chair
hard
by
him
and
though
she
held
a
book
in
her
hand
she
had
not
looked
into
it
for
some
time
well
indeed
said
clym
brushing
his
eyes
with
his
hands
how
soundly
i
have
slept
i
have
had
such
a
tremendous
dream
too
one
i
shall
never
forget
i
thought
you
had
been
dreaming
said
she
yes
it
was
about
my
mother
i
dreamt
that
i
took
you
to
her
house
to
make
up
differences
and
when
we
got
there
we
couldn
t
get
in
though
she
kept
on
crying
to
us
for
help
however
dreams
are
dreams
what
o
clock
is
it
eustacia
half
past
two
so
late
is
it
i
didn
t
mean
to
stay
so
long
by
the
time
i
have
had
something
to
eat
it
will
be
after
three
ann
is
not
come
back
from
the
village
and
i
thought
i
would
let
you
sleep
on
till
she
returned
clym
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
presently
he
said
musingly
week
after
week
passes
and
yet
mother
does
not
come
i
thought
i
should
have
heard
something
from
her
long
before
this
misgiving
regret
fear
resolution
ran
their
swift
course
of
expression
in
eustacia
s
dark
eyes
she
was
face
to
face
with
a
monstrous
difficulty
and
she
resolved
to
get
free
of
it
by
postponement
i
must
certainly
go
to
blooms
end
soon
he
continued
and
i
think
i
had
better
go
alone
he
picked
up
his
leggings
and
gloves
threw
them
down
again
and
added
as
dinner
will
be
so
late
today
i
will
not
go
back
to
the
heath
but
work
in
the
garden
till
the
evening
and
then
when
it
will
be
cooler
i
will
walk
to
blooms
end
i
am
quite
sure
that
if
i
make
a
little
advance
mother
will
be
willing
to
forget
all
it
will
be
rather
late
before
i
can
get
home
as
i
shall
not
be
able
to
do
the
distance
either
way
in
less
than
an
hour
and
a
half
but
you
will
not
mind
for
one
evening
dear
what
are
you
thinking
of
to
make
you
look
so
abstracted
i
cannot
tell
you
she
said
heavily
i
wish
we
didn
t
live
here
clym
the
world
seems
all
wrong
in
this
place
well
if
we
make
it
so
i
wonder
if
thomasin
has
been
to
blooms
end
lately
i
hope
so
but
probably
not
as
she
is
i
believe
expecting
to
be
confined
in
a
month
or
so
i
wish
i
had
thought
of
that
before
poor
mother
must
indeed
be
very
lonely
i
don
t
like
you
going
tonight
why
not
tonight
something
may
be
said
which
will
terribly
injure
me
my
mother
is
not
vindictive
said
clym
his
colour
faintly
rising
but
i
wish
you
would
not
go
eustacia
repeated
in
a
low
tone
if
you
agree
not
to
go
tonight
i
promise
to
go
by
myself
to
her
house
tomorrow
and
make
it
up
with
her
and
wait
till
you
fetch
me
why
do
you
want
to
do
that
at
this
particular
time
when
at
every
previous
time
that
i
have
proposed
it
you
have
refused
i
cannot
explain
further
than
that
i
should
like
to
see
her
alone
before
you
go
she
answered
with
an
impatient
move
of
her
head
and
looking
at
him
with
an
anxiety
more
frequently
seen
upon
those
of
a
sanguine
temperament
than
upon
such
as
herself
well
it
is
very
odd
that
just
when
i
had
decided
to
go
myself
you
should
want
to
do
what
i
proposed
long
ago
if
i
wait
for
you
to
go
tomorrow
another
day
will
be
lost
and
i
know
i
shall
be
unable
to
rest
another
night
without
having
been
i
want
to
get
this
settled
and
will
you
must
visit
her
afterwards
it
will
be
all
the
same
i
could
even
go
with
you
now
you
could
scarcely
walk
there
and
back
without
a
longer
rest
than
i
shall
take
no
not
tonight
eustacia
let
it
be
as
you
say
then
she
replied
in
the
quiet
way
of
one
who
though
willing
to
ward
off
evil
consequences
by
a
mild
effort
would
let
events
fall
out
as
they
might
sooner
than
wrestle
hard
to
direct
them
clym
then
went
into
the
garden
and
a
thoughtful
languor
stole
over
eustacia
for
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
which
her
husband
attributed
to
the
heat
of
the
weather
in
the
evening
he
set
out
on
the
journey
although
the
heat
of
summer
was
yet
intense
the
days
had
considerably
shortened
and
before
he
had
advanced
a
mile
on
his
way
all
the
heath
purples
browns
and
greens
had
merged
in
a
uniform
dress
without
airiness
or
graduation
and
broken
only
by
touches
of
white
where
the
little
heaps
of
clean
quartz
sand
showed
the
entrance
to
a
rabbit
burrow
or
where
the
white
flints
of
a
footpath
lay
like
a
thread
over
the
slopes
in
almost
every
one
of
the
isolated
and
stunted
thorns
which
grew
here
and
there
a
nighthawk
revealed
his
presence
by
whirring
like
the
clack
of
a
mill
as
long
as
he
could
hold
his
breath
then
stopping
flapping
his
wings
wheeling
round
the
bush
alighting
and
after
a
silent
interval
of
listening
beginning
to
whirr
again
at
each
brushing
of
clym
s
feet
white
millermoths
flew
into
the
air
just
high
enough
to
catch
upon
their
dusty
wings
the
mellowed
light
from
the
west
which
now
shone
across
the
depressions
and
levels
of
the
ground
without
falling
thereon
to
light
them
up
yeobright
walked
on
amid
this
quiet
scene
with
a
hope
that
all
would
soon
be
well
three
miles
on
he
came
to
a
spot
where
a
soft
perfume
was
wafted
across
his
path
and
he
stood
still
for
a
moment
to
inhale
the
familiar
scent
it
was
the
place
at
which
four
hours
earlier
his
mother
had
sat
down
exhausted
on
the
knoll
covered
with
shepherd
s
thyme
while
he
stood
a
sound
between
a
breathing
and
a
moan
suddenly
reached
his
ears
he
looked
to
where
the
sound
came
from
but
nothing
appeared
there
save
the
verge
of
the
hillock
stretching
against
the
sky
in
an
unbroken
line
he
moved
a
few
steps
in
that
direction
and
now
he
perceived
a
recumbent
figure
almost
close
to
his
feet
among
the
different
possibilities
as
to
the
person
s
individuality
there
did
not
for
a
moment
occur
to
yeobright
that
it
might
be
one
of
his
own
family
sometimes
furze
cutters
had
been
known
to
sleep
out
of
doors
at
these
times
to
save
a
long
journey
homeward
and
back
again
but
clym
remembered
the
moan
and
looked
closer
and
saw
that
the
form
was
feminine
and
a
distress
came
over
him
like
cold
air
from
a
cave
but
he
was
not
absolutely
certain
that
the
woman
was
his
mother
till
he
stooped
and
beheld
her
face
pallid
and
with
closed
eyes
his
breath
went
as
it
were
out
of
his
body
and
the
cry
of
anguish
which
would
have
escaped
him
died
upon
his
lips
during
the
momentary
interval
that
elapsed
before
he
became
conscious
that
something
must
be
done
all
sense
of
time
and
place
left
him
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
and
his
mother
were
as
when
he
was
a
child
with
her
many
years
ago
on
this
heath
at
hours
similar
to
the
present
then
he
awoke
to
activity
and
bending
yet
lower
he
found
that
she
still
breathed
and
that
her
breath
though
feeble
was
regular
except
when
disturbed
by
an
occasional
gasp
o
what
is
it
mother
are
you
very
ill
you
are
not
dying
he
cried
pressing
his
lips
to
her
face
i
am
your
clym
how
did
you
come
here
what
does
it
all
mean
at
that
moment
the
chasm
in
their
lives
which
his
love
for
eustacia
had
caused
was
not
remembered
by
yeobright
and
to
him
the
present
joined
continuously
with
that
friendly
past
that
had
been
their
experience
before
the
division
she
moved
her
lips
appeared
to
know
him
but
could
not
speak
and
then
clym
strove
to
consider
how
best
to
move
her
as
it
would
be
necessary
to
get
her
away
from
the
spot
before
the
dews
were
intense
he
was
able
bodied
and
his
mother
was
thin
he
clasped
his
arms
round
her
lifted
her
a
little
and
said
does
that
hurt
you
she
shook
her
head
and
he
lifted
her
up
then
at
a
slow
pace
went
onward
with
his
load
the
air
was
now
completely
cool
but
whenever
he
passed
over
a
sandy
patch
of
ground
uncarpeted
with
vegetation
there
was
reflected
from
its
surface
into
his
face
the
heat
which
it
had
imbibed
during
the
day
at
the
beginning
of
his
undertaking
he
had
thought
but
little
of
the
distance
which
yet
would
have
to
be
traversed
before
blooms
end
could
be
reached
but
though
he
had
slept
that
afternoon
he
soon
began
to
feel
the
weight
of
his
burden
thus
he
proceeded
like
aeneas
with
his
father
the
bats
circling
round
his
head
nightjars
flapping
their
wings
within
a
yard
of
his
face
and
not
a
human
being
within
call
while
he
was
yet
nearly
a
mile
from
the
house
his
mother
exhibited
signs
of
restlessness
under
the
constraint
of
being
borne
along
as
if
his
arms
were
irksome
to
her
he
lowered
her
upon
his
knees
and
looked
around
the
point
they
had
now
reached
though
far
from
any
road
was
not
more
than
a
mile
from
the
blooms
end
cottages
occupied
by
fairway
sam
humphrey
and
the
cantles
moreover
fifty
yards
off
stood
a
hut
built
of
clods
and
covered
with
thin
turves
but
now
entirely
disused
the
simple
outline
of
the
lonely
shed
was
visible
and
thither
he
determined
to
direct
his
steps
as
soon
as
he
arrived
he
laid
her
down
carefully
by
the
entrance
and
then
ran
and
cut
with
his
pocketknife
an
armful
of
the
dryest
fern
spreading
this
within
the
shed
which
was
entirely
open
on
one
side
he
placed
his
mother
thereon
then
he
ran
with
all
his
might
towards
the
dwelling
of
fairway
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
passed
disturbed
only
by
the
broken
breathing
of
the
sufferer
when
moving
figures
began
to
animate
the
line
between
heath
and
sky
in
a
few
moments
clym
arrived
with
fairway
humphrey
and
susan
nunsuch
olly
dowden
who
had
chanced
to
be
at
fairway
s
christian
and
grandfer
cantle
following
helter
skelter
behind
they
had
brought
a
lantern
and
matches
water
a
pillow
and
a
few
other
articles
which
had
occurred
to
their
minds
in
the
hurry
of
the
moment
sam
had
been
despatched
back
again
for
brandy
and
a
boy
brought
fairway
s
pony
upon
which
he
rode
off
to
the
nearest
medical
man
with
directions
to
call
at
wildeve
s
on
his
way
and
inform
thomasin
that
her
aunt
was
unwell
sam
and
the
brandy
soon
arrived
and
it
was
administered
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
after
which
she
became
sufficiently
conscious
to
signify
by
signs
that
something
was
wrong
with
her
foot
olly
dowden
at
length
understood
her
meaning
and
examined
the
foot
indicated
it
was
swollen
and
red
even
as
they
watched
the
red
began
to
assume
a
more
livid
colour
in
the
midst
of
which
appeared
a
scarlet
speck
smaller
than
a
pea
and
it
was
found
to
consist
of
a
drop
of
blood
which
rose
above
the
smooth
flesh
of
her
ankle
in
a
hemisphere
i
know
what
it
is
cried
sam
she
has
been
stung
by
an
adder
yes
said
clym
instantly
i
remember
when
i
was
a
child
seeing
just
such
a
bite
o
my
poor
mother
it
was
my
father
who
was
bit
said
sam
and
there
s
only
one
way
to
cure
it
you
must
rub
the
place
with
the
fat
of
other
adders
and
the
only
way
to
get
that
is
by
frying
them
that
s
what
they
did
for
him
tis
an
old
remedy
said
clym
distrustfully
and
i
have
doubts
about
it
but
we
can
do
nothing
else
till
the
doctor
comes
tis
a
sure
cure
said
olly
dowden
with
emphasis
i
ve
used
it
when
i
used
to
go
out
nursing
then
we
must
pray
for
daylight
to
catch
them
said
clym
gloomily
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
said
sam
he
took
a
green
hazel
which
he
had
used
as
a
walking
stick
split
it
at
the
end
inserted
a
small
pebble
and
with
the
lantern
in
his
hand
went
out
into
the
heath
clym
had
by
this
time
lit
a
small
fire
and
despatched
susan
nunsuch
for
a
frying
pan
before
she
had
returned
sam
came
in
with
three
adders
one
briskly
coiling
and
uncoiling
in
the
cleft
of
the
stick
and
the
other
two
hanging
dead
across
it
i
have
only
been
able
to
get
one
alive
and
fresh
as
he
ought
to
be
said
sam
these
limp
ones
are
two
i
killed
today
at
work
but
as
they
don
t
die
till
the
sun
goes
down
they
can
t
be
very
stale
meat
the
live
adder
regarded
the
assembled
group
with
a
sinister
look
in
its
small
black
eye
and
the
beautiful
brown
and
jet
pattern
on
its
back
seemed
to
intensify
with
indignation
mrs
yeobright
saw
the
creature
and
the
creature
saw
her
she
quivered
throughout
and
averted
her
eyes
look
at
that
murmured
christian
cantle
neighbours
how
do
we
know
but
that
something
of
the
old
serpent
in
god
s
garden
that
gied
the
apple
to
the
young
woman
with
no
clothes
lives
on
in
adders
and
snakes
still
look
at
his
eye
for
all
the
world
like
a
villainous
sort
of
black
currant
tis
to
be
hoped
he
can
t
ill
wish
us
there
s
folks
in
heath
who
ve
been
overlooked
already
i
will
never
kill
another
adder
as
long
as
i
live
well
tis
right
to
be
afeard
of
things
if
folks
can
t
help
it
said
grandfer
cantle
twould
have
saved
me
many
a
brave
danger
in
my
time
i
fancy
i
heard
something
outside
the
shed
said
christian
i
wish
troubles
would
come
in
the
daytime
for
then
a
man
could
show
his
courage
and
hardly
beg
for
mercy
of
the
most
broomstick
old
woman
he
should
see
if
he
was
a
brave
man
and
able
to
run
out
of
her
sight
even
such
an
ignorant
fellow
as
i
should
know
better
than
do
that
said
sam
well
there
s
calamities
where
we
least
expect
it
whether
or
no
neighbours
if
mrs
yeobright
were
to
die
d
ye
think
we
should
be
took
up
and
tried
for
the
manslaughter
of
a
woman
no
they
couldn
t
bring
it
in
as
that
said
sam
unless
they
could
prove
we
had
been
poachers
at
some
time
of
our
lives
but
she
ll
fetch
round
now
if
i
had
been
stung
by
ten
adders
i
should
hardly
have
lost
a
day
s
work
for
t
said
grandfer
cantle
such
is
my
spirit
when
i
am
on
my
mettle
but
perhaps
tis
natural
in
a
man
trained
for
war
yes
i
ve
gone
through
a
good
deal
but
nothing
ever
came
amiss
to
me
after
i
joined
the
locals
in
four
he
shook
his
head
and
smiled
at
a
mental
picture
of
himself
in
uniform
i
was
always
first
in
the
most
galliantest
scrapes
in
my
younger
days
i
suppose
that
was
because
they
always
used
to
put
the
biggest
fool
afore
said
fairway
from
the
fire
beside
which
he
knelt
blowing
it
with
his
breath
d
ye
think
so
timothy
said
grandfer
cantle
coming
forward
to
fairway
s
side
with
sudden
depression
in
his
face
then
a
man
may
feel
for
years
that
he
is
good
solid
company
and
be
wrong
about
himself
after
all
never
mind
that
question
grandfer
stir
your
stumps
and
get
some
more
sticks
tis
very
nonsense
of
an
old
man
to
prattle
so
when
life
and
death
s
in
mangling
yes
yes
said
grandfer
cantle
with
melancholy
conviction
well
this
is
a
bad
night
altogether
for
them
that
have
done
well
in
their
time
and
if
i
were
ever
such
a
dab
at
the
hautboy
or
tenor
viol
i
shouldn
t
have
the
heart
to
play
tunes
upon
em
now
susan
now
arrived
with
the
frying
pan
when
the
live
adder
was
killed
and
the
heads
of
the
three
taken
off
the
remainders
being
cut
into
lengths
and
split
open
were
tossed
into
the
pan
which
began
hissing
and
crackling
over
the
fire
soon
a
rill
of
clear
oil
trickled
from
the
carcases
whereupon
clym
dipped
the
corner
of
his
handkerchief
into
the
liquid
and
anointed
the
wound
eustacia
hears
of
good
fortune
and
beholds
evil
in
the
meantime
eustacia
left
alone
in
her
cottage
at
alderworth
had
become
considerably
depressed
by
the
posture
of
affairs
the
consequences
which
might
result
from
clym
s
discovery
that
his
mother
had
been
turned
from
his
door
that
day
were
likely
to
be
disagreeable
and
this
was
a
quality
in
events
which
she
hated
as
much
as
the
dreadful
to
be
left
to
pass
the
evening
by
herself
was
irksome
to
her
at
any
time
and
this
evening
it
was
more
irksome
than
usual
by
reason
of
the
excitements
of
the
past
hours
the
two
visits
had
stirred
her
into
restlessness
she
was
not
wrought
to
any
great
pitch
of
uneasiness
by
the
probability
of
appearing
in
an
ill
light
in
the
discussion
between
clym
and
his
mother
but
she
was
wrought
to
vexation
and
her
slumbering
activities
were
quickened
to
the
extent
of
wishing
that
she
had
opened
the
door
she
had
certainly
believed
that
clym
was
awake
and
the
excuse
would
be
an
honest
one
as
far
as
it
went
but
nothing
could
save
her
from
censure
in
refusing
to
answer
at
the
first
knock
yet
instead
of
blaming
herself
for
the
issue
she
laid
the
fault
upon
the
shoulders
of
some
indistinct
colossal
prince
of
the
world
who
had
framed
her
situation
and
ruled
her
lot
at
this
time
of
the
year
it
was
pleasanter
to
walk
by
night
than
by
day
and
when
clym
had
been
absent
about
an
hour
she
suddenly
resolved
to
go
out
in
the
direction
of
blooms
end
on
the
chance
of
meeting
him
on
his
return
when
she
reached
the
garden
gate
she
heard
wheels
approaching
and
looking
round
beheld
her
grandfather
coming
up
in
his
car
i
can
t
stay
a
minute
thank
ye
he
answered
to
her
greeting
i
am
driving
to
east
egdon
but
i
came
round
here
just
to
tell
you
the
news
perhaps
you
have
heard
about
mr
wildeve
s
fortune
no
said
eustacia
blankly
well
he
has
come
into
a
fortune
of
eleven
thousand
pounds
uncle
died
in
canada
just
after
hearing
that
all
his
family
whom
he
was
sending
home
had
gone
to
the
bottom
in
the
cassiopeia
so
wildeve
has
come
into
everything
without
in
the
least
expecting
it
eustacia
stood
motionless
awhile
how
long
has
he
known
of
this
she
asked
well
it
was
known
to
him
this
morning
early
for
i
knew
it
at
ten
o
clock
when
charley
came
back
now
he
is
what
i
call
a
lucky
man
what
a
fool
you
were
eustacia
in
what
way
she
said
lifting
her
eyes
in
apparent
calmness
why
in
not
sticking
to
him
when
you
had
him
had
him
indeed
i
did
not
know
there
had
ever
been
anything
between
you
till
lately
and
faith
i
should
have
been
hot
and
strong
against
it
if
i
had
known
but
since
it
seems
that
there
was
some
sniffing
between
ye
why
the
deuce
didn
t
you
stick
to
him
eustacia
made
no
reply
but
she
looked
as
if
she
could
say
as
much
upon
that
subject
as
he
if
she
chose
and
how
is
your
poor
purblind
husband
continued
the
old
man
not
a
bad
fellow
either
as
far
as
he
goes
he
is
quite
well
it
is
a
good
thing
for
his
cousin
what
d
ye
call
her
by
george
you
ought
to
have
been
in
that
galley
my
girl
now
i
must
drive
on
do
you
want
any
assistance
what
s
mine
is
yours
you
know
thank
you
grandfather
we
are
not
in
want
at
present
she
said
coldly
clym
cuts
furze
but
he
does
it
mostly
as
a
useful
pastime
because
he
can
do
nothing
else
he
is
paid
for
his
pastime
isn
t
he
three
shillings
a
hundred
i
heard
clym
has
money
she
said
colouring
but
he
likes
to
earn
a
little
very
well
good
night
and
the
captain
drove
on
when
her
grandfather
was
gone
eustacia
went
on
her
way
mechanically
but
her
thoughts
were
no
longer
concerning
her
mother
in
law
and
clym
wildeve
notwithstanding
his
complaints
against
his
fate
had
been
seized
upon
by
destiny
and
placed
in
the
sunshine
once
more
eleven
thousand
pounds
from
every
egdon
point
of
view
he
was
a
rich
man
in
eustacia
s
eyes
too
it
was
an
ample
sum
one
sufficient
to
supply
those
wants
of
hers
which
had
been
stigmatized
by
clym
in
his
more
austere
moods
as
vain
and
luxurious
though
she
was
no
lover
of
money
she
loved
what
money
could
bring
and
the
new
accessories
she
imagined
around
him
clothed
wildeve
with
a
great
deal
of
interest
she
recollected
now
how
quietly
well
dressed
he
had
been
that
morning
he
had
probably
put
on
his
newest
suit
regardless
of
damage
by
briars
and
thorns
and
then
she
thought
of
his
manner
towards
herself
o
i
see
it
i
see
it
she
said
how
much
he
wishes
he
had
me
now
that
he
might
give
me
all
i
desire
in
recalling
the
details
of
his
glances
and
words
at
the
time
scarcely
regarded
it
became
plain
to
her
how
greatly
they
had
been
dictated
by
his
knowledge
of
this
new
event
had
he
been
a
man
to
bear
a
jilt
ill
will
he
would
have
told
me
of
his
good
fortune
in
crowing
tones
instead
of
doing
that
he
mentioned
not
a
word
in
deference
to
my
misfortunes
and
merely
implied
that
he
loved
me
still
as
one
superior
to
him
wildeve
s
silence
that
day
on
what
had
happened
to
him
was
just
the
kind
of
behaviour
calculated
to
make
an
impression
on
such
a
woman
those
delicate
touches
of
good
taste
were
in
fact
one
of
the
strong
points
in
his
demeanour
towards
the
other
sex
the
peculiarity
of
wildeve
was
that
while
at
one
time
passionate
upbraiding
and
resentful
towards
a
woman
at
another
he
would
treat
her
with
such
unparalleled
grace
as
to
make
previous
neglect
appear
as
no
discourtesy
injury
as
no
insult
interference
as
a
delicate
attention
and
the
ruin
of
her
honour
as
excess
of
chivalry
this
man
whose
admiration
today
eustacia
had
disregarded
whose
good
wishes
she
had
scarcely
taken
the
trouble
to
accept
whom
she
had
shown
out
of
the
house
by
the
back
door
was
the
possessor
of
eleven
thousand
pounds
a
man
of
fair
professional
education
and
one
who
had
served
his
articles
with
a
civil
engineer
so
intent
was
eustacia
upon
wildeve
s
fortunes
that
she
forgot
how
much
closer
to
her
own
course
were
those
of
clym
and
instead
of
walking
on
to
meet
him
at
once
she
sat
down
upon
a
stone
she
was
disturbed
in
her
reverie
by
a
voice
behind
and
turning
her
head
beheld
the
old
lover
and
fortunate
inheritor
of
wealth
immediately
beside
her
she
remained
sitting
though
the
fluctuation
in
her
look
might
have
told
any
man
who
knew
her
so
well
as
wildeve
that
she
was
thinking
of
him
how
did
you
come
here
she
said
in
her
clear
low
tone
i
thought
you
were
at
home
i
went
on
to
the
village
after
leaving
your
garden
and
now
i
have
come
back
again
that
s
all
which
way
are
you
walking
may
i
ask
she
waved
her
hand
in
the
direction
of
blooms
end
i
am
going
to
meet
my
husband
i
think
i
may
possibly
have
got
into
trouble
whilst
you
were
with
me
today
how
could
that
be
by
not
letting
in
mrs
yeobright
i
hope
that
visit
of
mine
did
you
no
harm
none
it
was
not
your
fault
she
said
quietly
by
this
time
she
had
risen
and
they
involuntarily
sauntered
on
together
without
speaking
for
two
or
three
minutes
when
eustacia
broke
silence
by
saying
i
assume
i
must
congratulate
you
on
what
o
yes
on
my
eleven
thousand
pounds
you
mean
well
since
i
didn
t
get
something
else
i
must
be
content
with
getting
that
you
seem
very
indifferent
about
it
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
today
when
you
came
she
said
in
the
tone
of
a
neglected
person
i
heard
of
it
quite
by
accident
i
did
mean
to
tell
you
said
wildeve
but
i
well
i
will
speak
frankly
i
did
not
like
to
mention
it
when
i
saw
eustacia
that
your
star
was
not
high
the
sight
of
a
man
lying
wearied
out
with
hard
work
as
your
husband
lay
made
me
feel
that
to
brag
of
my
own
fortune
to
you
would
be
greatly
out
of
place
yet
as
you
stood
there
beside
him
i
could
not
help
feeling
too
that
in
many
respects
he
was
a
richer
man
than
i
at
this
eustacia
said
with
slumbering
mischievousness
what
would
you
exchange
with
him
your
fortune
for
me
i
certainly
would
said
wildeve
as
we
are
imagining
what
is
impossible
and
absurd
suppose
we
change
the
subject
very
well
and
i
will
tell
you
of
my
plans
for
the
future
if
you
care
to
hear
them
i
shall
permanently
invest
nine
thousand
pounds
keep
one
thousand
as
ready
money
and
with
the
remaining
thousand
travel
for
a
year
or
so
travel
what
a
bright
idea
where
will
you
go
to
from
here
to
paris
where
i
shall
pass
the
winter
and
spring
then
i
shall
go
to
italy
greece
egypt
and
palestine
before
the
hot
weather
comes
on
in
the
summer
i
shall
go
to
america
and
then
by
a
plan
not
yet
settled
i
shall
go
to
australia
and
round
to
india
by
that
time
i
shall
have
begun
to
have
had
enough
of
it
then
i
shall
probably
come
back
to
paris
again
and
there
i
shall
stay
as
long
as
i
can
afford
to
back
to
paris
again
she
murmured
in
a
voice
that
was
nearly
a
sigh
she
had
never
once
told
wildeve
of
the
parisian
desires
which
clym
s
description
had
sown
in
her
yet
here
was
he
involuntarily
in
a
position
to
gratify
them
you
think
a
good
deal
of
paris
she
added
yes
in
my
opinion
it
is
the
central
beauty
spot
of
the
world
and
in
mine
and
thomasin
will
go
with
you
yes
if
she
cares
to
she
may
prefer
to
stay
at
home
so
you
will
be
going
about
and
i
shall
be
staying
here
i
suppose
you
will
but
we
know
whose
fault
that
is
i
am
not
blaming
you
she
said
quickly
oh
i
thought
you
were
if
ever
you
should
be
inclined
to
blame
me
think
of
a
certain
evening
by
rainbarrow
when
you
promised
to
meet
me
and
did
not
you
sent
me
a
letter
and
my
heart
ached
to
read
that
as
i
hope
yours
never
will
that
was
one
point
of
divergence
i
then
did
something
in
haste
but
she
is
a
good
woman
and
i
will
say
no
more
i
know
that
the
blame
was
on
my
side
that
time
said
eustacia
but
it
had
not
always
been
so
however
it
is
my
misfortune
to
be
too
sudden
in
feeling
o
damon
don
t
reproach
me
any
more
i
can
t
bear
that
they
went
on
silently
for
a
distance
of
two
or
three
miles
when
eustacia
said
suddenly
haven
t
you
come
out
of
your
way
mr
wildeve
my
way
is
anywhere
tonight
i
will
go
with
you
as
far
as
the
hill
on
which
we
can
see
blooms
end
as
it
is
getting
late
for
you
to
be
alone
don
t
trouble
i
am
not
obliged
to
be
out
at
all
i
think
i
would
rather
you
did
not
accompany
me
further
this
sort
of
thing
would
have
an
odd
look
if
known
very
well
i
will
leave
you
he
took
her
hand
unexpectedly
and
kissed
it
for
the
first
time
since
her
marriage
what
light
is
that
on
the
hill
he
added
as
it
were
to
hide
the
caress
she
looked
and
saw
a
flickering
firelight
proceeding
from
the
open
side
of
a
hovel
a
little
way
before
them
the
hovel
which
she
had
hitherto
always
found
empty
seemed
to
be
inhabited
now
since
you
have
come
so
far
said
eustacia
will
you
see
me
safely
past
that
hut
i
thought
i
should
have
met
clym
somewhere
about
here
but
as
he
doesn
t
appear
i
will
hasten
on
and
get
to
blooms
end
before
he
leaves
they
advanced
to
the
turf
shed
and
when
they
got
near
it
the
firelight
and
the
lantern
inside
showed
distinctly
enough
the
form
of
a
woman
reclining
on
a
bed
of
fern
a
group
of
heath
men
and
women
standing
around
her
eustacia
did
not
recognize
mrs
yeobright
in
the
reclining
figure
nor
clym
as
one
of
the
standers
by
till
she
came
close
then
she
quickly
pressed
her
hand
up
on
wildeve
s
arm
and
signified
to
him
to
come
back
from
the
open
side
of
the
shed
into
the
shadow
it
is
my
husband
and
his
mother
she
whispered
in
an
agitated
voice
what
can
it
mean
will
you
step
forward
and
tell
me
wildeve
left
her
side
and
went
to
the
back
wall
of
the
hut
presently
eustacia
perceived
that
he
was
beckoning
to
her
and
she
advanced
and
joined
him
it
is
a
serious
case
said
wildeve
from
their
position
they
could
hear
what
was
proceeding
inside
i
cannot
think
where
she
could
have
been
going
said
clym
to
someone
she
had
evidently
walked
a
long
way
but
even
when
she
was
able
to
speak
just
now
she
would
not
tell
me
where
what
do
you
really
think
of
her
there
is
a
great
deal
to
fear
was
gravely
answered
in
a
voice
which
eustacia
recognized
as
that
of
the
only
surgeon
in
the
district
she
has
suffered
somewhat
from
the
bite
of
the
adder
but
it
is
exhaustion
which
has
overpowered
her
my
impression
is
that
her
walk
must
have
been
exceptionally
long
i
used
to
tell
her
not
to
overwalk
herself
this
weather
said
clym
with
distress
do
you
think
we
did
well
in
using
the
adder
s
fat
well
it
is
a
very
ancient
remedy
the
old
remedy
of
the
viper
catchers
i
believe
replied
the
doctor
it
is
mentioned
as
an
infallible
ointment
by
hoffman
mead
and
i
think
the
abbe
fontana
undoubtedly
it
was
as
good
a
thing
as
you
could
do
though
i
question
if
some
other
oils
would
not
have
been
equally
efficacious
come
here
come
here
was
then
rapidly
said
in
anxious
female
tones
and
clym
and
the
doctor
could
be
heard
rushing
forward
from
the
back
part
of
the
shed
to
where
mrs
yeobright
lay
oh
what
is
it
whispered
eustacia
twas
thomasin
who
spoke
said
wildeve
then
they
have
fetched
her
i
wonder
if
i
had
better
go
in
yet
it
might
do
harm
for
a
long
time
there
was
utter
silence
among
the
group
within
and
it
was
broken
at
last
by
clym
saying
in
an
agonized
voice
o
doctor
what
does
it
mean
the
doctor
did
not
reply
at
once
ultimately
he
said
she
is
sinking
fast
her
heart
was
previously
affected
and
physical
exhaustion
has
dealt
the
finishing
blow
then
there
was
a
weeping
of
women
then
waiting
then
hushed
exclamations
then
a
strange
gasping
sound
then
a
painful
stillness
it
is
all
over
said
the
doctor
further
back
in
the
hut
the
cotters
whispered
mrs
yeobright
is
dead
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
two
watchers
observed
the
form
of
a
small
old
fashioned
child
entering
at
the
open
side
of
the
shed
susan
nunsuch
whose
boy
it
was
went
forward
to
the
opening
and
silently
beckoned
to
him
to
go
back
i
ve
got
something
to
tell
ee
mother
he
cried
in
a
shrill
tone
that
woman
asleep
there
walked
along
with
me
today
and
she
said
i
was
to
say
that
i
had
seed
her
and
she
was
a
broken
hearted
woman
and
cast
off
by
her
son
and
then
i
came
on
home
a
confused
sob
as
from
a
man
was
heard
within
upon
which
eustacia
gasped
faintly
that
s
clym
i
must
go
to
him
yet
dare
i
do
it
no
come
away
when
they
had
withdrawn
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
shed
she
said
huskily
i
am
to
blame
for
this
there
is
evil
in
store
for
me
was
she
not
admitted
to
your
house
after
all
wildeve
inquired
no
and
that
s
where
it
all
lies
oh
what
shall
i
do
i
shall
not
intrude
upon
them
i
shall
go
straight
home
damon
good
bye
i
cannot
speak
to
you
any
more
now
they
parted
company
and
when
eustacia
had
reached
the
next
hill
she
looked
back
a
melancholy
procession
was
wending
its
way
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
from
the
hut
towards
blooms
end
wildeve
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
book
five
the
discovery
wherefore
is
light
given
to
him
that
is
in
misery
one
evening
about
three
weeks
after
the
funeral
of
mrs
yeobright
when
the
silver
face
of
the
moon
sent
a
bundle
of
beams
directly
upon
the
floor
of
clym
s
house
at
alderworth
a
woman
came
forth
from
within
she
reclined
over
the
garden
gate
as
if
to
refresh
herself
awhile
the
pale
lunar
touches
which
make
beauties
of
hags
lent
divinity
to
this
face
already
beautiful
she
had
not
long
been
there
when
a
man
came
up
the
road
and
with
some
hesitation
said
to
her
how
is
he
tonight
ma
am
if
you
please
he
is
better
though
still
very
unwell
humphrey
replied
eustacia
is
he
light
headed
ma
am
no
he
is
quite
sensible
now
do
he
rave
about
his
mother
just
the
same
poor
fellow
continued
humphrey
just
as
much
though
not
quite
so
wildly
she
said
in
a
low
voice
it
was
very
unfortunate
ma
am
that
the
boy
johnny
should
ever
ha
told
him
his
mother
s
dying
words
about
her
being
broken
hearted
and
cast
off
by
her
son
twas
enough
to
upset
any
man
alive
eustacia
made
no
reply
beyond
that
of
a
slight
catch
in
her
breath
as
of
one
who
fain
would
speak
but
could
not
and
humphrey
declining
her
invitation
to
come
in
went
away
eustacia
turned
entered
the
house
and
ascended
to
the
front
bedroom
where
a
shaded
light
was
burning
in
the
bed
lay
clym
pale
haggard
wide
awake
tossing
to
one
side
and
to
the
other
his
eyes
lit
by
a
hot
light
as
if
the
fire
in
their
pupils
were
burning
up
their
substance
is
it
you
eustacia
he
said
as
she
sat
down
yes
clym
i
have
been
down
to
the
gate
the
moon
is
shining
beautifully
and
there
is
not
a
leaf
stirring
shining
is
it
what
s
the
moon
to
a
man
like
me
let
it
shine
let
anything
be
so
that
i
never
see
another
day
eustacia
i
don
t
know
where
to
look
my
thoughts
go
through
me
like
swords
o
if
any
man
wants
to
make
himself
immortal
by
painting
a
picture
of
wretchedness
let
him
come
here
why
do
you
say
so
i
cannot
help
feeling
that
i
did
my
best
to
kill
her
no
clym
yes
it
was
so
it
is
useless
to
excuse
me
my
conduct
to
her
was
too
hideous
i
made
no
advances
and
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
forgive
me
now
she
is
dead
if
i
had
only
shown
myself
willing
to
make
it
up
with
her
sooner
and
we
had
been
friends
and
then
she
had
died
it
wouldn
t
be
so
hard
to
bear
but
i
never
went
near
her
house
so
she
never
came
near
mine
and
didn
t
know
how
welcome
she
would
have
been
that
s
what
troubles
me
she
did
not
know
i
was
going
to
her
house
that
very
night
for
she
was
too
insensible
to
understand
me
if
she
had
only
come
to
see
me
i
longed
that
she
would
but
it
was
not
to
be
there
escaped
from
eustacia
one
of
those
shivering
sighs
which
used
to
shake
her
like
a
pestilent
blast
she
had
not
yet
told
but
yeobright
was
too
deeply
absorbed
in
the
ramblings
incidental
to
his
remorseful
state
to
notice
her
during
his
illness
he
had
been
continually
talking
thus
despair
had
been
added
to
his
original
grief
by
the
unfortunate
disclosure
of
the
boy
who
had
received
the
last
words
of
mrs
yeobright
words
too
bitterly
uttered
in
an
hour
of
misapprehension
then
his
distress
had
overwhelmed
him
and
he
longed
for
death
as
a
field
labourer
longs
for
the
shade
it
was
the
pitiful
sight
of
a
man
standing
in
the
very
focus
of
sorrow
he
continually
bewailed
his
tardy
journey
to
his
mother
s
house
because
it
was
an
error
which
could
never
be
rectified
and
insisted
that
he
must
have
been
horribly
perverted
by
some
fiend
not
to
have
thought
before
that
it
was
his
duty
to
go
to
her
since
she
did
not
come
to
him
he
would
ask
eustacia
to
agree
with
him
in
his
self
condemnation
and
when
she
seared
inwardly
by
a
secret
she
dared
not
tell
declared
that
she
could
not
give
an
opinion
he
would
say
that
s
because
you
didn
t
know
my
mother
s
nature
she
was
always
ready
to
forgive
if
asked
to
do
so
but
i
seemed
to
her
to
be
as
an
obstinate
child
and
that
made
her
unyielding
yet
not
unyielding
she
was
proud
and
reserved
no
more
yes
i
can
understand
why
she
held
out
against
me
so
long
she
was
waiting
for
me
i
dare
say
she
said
a
hundred
times
in
her
sorrow
what
a
return
he
makes
for
all
the
sacrifices
i
have
made
for
him
i
never
went
to
her
when
i
set
out
to
visit
her
it
was
too
late
to
think
of
that
is
nearly
intolerable
sometimes
his
condition
had
been
one
of
utter
remorse
unsoftened
by
a
single
tear
of
pure
sorrow
and
then
he
writhed
as
he
lay
fevered
far
more
by
thought
than
by
physical
ills
if
i
could
only
get
one
assurance
that
she
did
not
die
in
a
belief
that
i
was
resentful
he
said
one
day
when
in
this
mood
it
would
be
better
to
think
of
than
a
hope
of
heaven
but
that
i
cannot
do
you
give
yourself
up
too
much
to
this
wearying
despair
said
eustacia
other
men
s
mothers
have
died
that
doesn
t
make
the
loss
of
mine
less
yet
it
is
less
the
loss
than
the
circumstances
of
the
loss
i
sinned
against
her
and
on
that
account
there
is
no
light
for
me
she
sinned
against
you
i
think
no
she
did
not
i
committed
the
guilt
and
may
the
whole
burden
be
upon
my
head
i
think
you
might
consider
twice
before
you
say
that
eustacia
replied
single
men
have
no
doubt
a
right
to
curse
themselves
as
much
as
they
please
but
men
with
wives
involve
two
in
the
doom
they
pray
down
i
am
in
too
sorry
a
state
to
understand
what
you
are
refining
on
said
the
wretched
man
day
and
night
shout
at
me
you
have
helped
to
kill
her
but
in
loathing
myself
i
may
i
own
be
unjust
to
you
my
poor
wife
forgive
me
for
it
eustacia
for
i
scarcely
know
what
i
do
eustacia
was
always
anxious
to
avoid
the
sight
of
her
husband
in
such
a
state
as
this
which
had
become
as
dreadful
to
her
as
the
trial
scene
was
to
judas
iscariot
it
brought
before
her
eyes
the
spectre
of
a
worn
out
woman
knocking
at
a
door
which
she
would
not
open
and
she
shrank
from
contemplating
it
yet
it
was
better
for
yeobright
himself
when
he
spoke
openly
of
his
sharp
regret
for
in
silence
he
endured
infinitely
more
and
would
sometimes
remain
so
long
in
a
tense
brooding
mood
consuming
himself
by
the
gnawing
of
his
thought
that
it
was
imperatively
necessary
to
make
him
talk
aloud
that
his
grief
might
in
some
degree
expend
itself
in
the
effort
eustacia
had
not
been
long
indoors
after
her
look
at
the
moonlight
when
a
soft
footstep
came
up
to
the
house
and
thomasin
was
announced
by
the
woman
downstairs
ah
thomasin
thank
you
for
coming
tonight
said
clym
when
she
entered
the
room
here
am
i
you
see
such
a
wretched
spectacle
am
i
that
i
shrink
from
being
seen
by
a
single
friend
and
almost
from
you
you
must
not
shrink
from
me
dear
clym
said
thomasin
earnestly
in
that
sweet
voice
of
hers
which
came
to
a
sufferer
like
fresh
air
into
a
black
hole
nothing
in
you
can
ever
shock
me
or
drive
me
away
i
have
been
here
before
but
you
don
t
remember
it
yes
i
do
i
am
not
delirious
thomasin
nor
have
i
been
so
at
all
don
t
you
believe
that
if
they
say
so
i
am
only
in
great
misery
at
what
i
have
done
and
that
with
the
weakness
makes
me
seem
mad
but
it
has
not
upset
my
reason
do
you
think
i
should
remember
all
about
my
mother
s
death
if
i
were
out
of
my
mind
no
such
good
luck
two
months
and
a
half
thomasin
the
last
of
her
life
did
my
poor
mother
live
alone
distracted
and
mourning
because
of
me
yet
she
was
unvisited
by
me
though
i
was
living
only
six
miles
off
two
months
and
a
half
seventy
five
days
did
the
sun
rise
and
set
upon
her
in
that
deserted
state
which
a
dog
didn
t
deserve
poor
people
who
had
nothing
in
common
with
her
would
have
cared
for
her
and
visited
her
had
they
known
her
sickness
and
loneliness
but
i
who
should
have
been
all
to
her
stayed
away
like
a
cur
if
there
is
any
justice
in
god
let
him
kill
me
now
he
has
nearly
blinded
me
but
that
is
not
enough
if
he
would
only
strike
me
with
more
pain
i
would
believe
in
him
forever
hush
hush
o
pray
clym
don
t
don
t
say
it
implored
thomasin
affrighted
into
sobs
and
tears
while
eustacia
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
though
her
pale
face
remained
calm
writhed
in
her
chair
clym
went
on
without
heeding
his
cousin
but
i
am
not
worth
receiving
further
proof
even
of
heaven
s
reprobation
do
you
think
thomasin
that
she
knew
me
that
she
did
not
die
in
that
horrid
mistaken
notion
about
my
not
forgiving
her
which
i
can
t
tell
you
how
she
acquired
if
you
could
only
assure
me
of
that
do
you
think
so
eustacia
do
speak
to
me
i
think
i
can
assure
you
that
she
knew
better
at
last
said
thomasin
the
pallid
eustacia
said
nothing
why
didn
t
she
come
to
my
house
i
would
have
taken
her
in
and
showed
her
how
i
loved
her
in
spite
of
all
but
she
never
came
and
i
didn
t
go
to
her
and
she
died
on
the
heath
like
an
animal
kicked
out
nobody
to
help
her
till
it
was
too
late
if
you
could
have
seen
her
thomasin
as
i
saw
her
a
poor
dying
woman
lying
in
the
dark
upon
the
bare
ground
moaning
nobody
near
believing
she
was
utterly
deserted
by
all
the
world
it
would
have
moved
you
to
anguish
it
would
have
moved
a
brute
and
this
poor
woman
my
mother
no
wonder
she
said
to
the
child
you
have
seen
a
broken
hearted
woman
what
a
state
she
must
have
been
brought
to
to
say
that
and
who
can
have
done
it
but
i
it
is
too
dreadful
to
think
of
and
i
wish
i
could
be
punished
more
heavily
than
i
am
how
long
was
i
what
they
called
out
of
my
senses
a
week
i
think
and
then
i
became
calm
yes
for
four
days
and
now
i
have
left
off
being
calm
but
try
to
be
quiet
please
do
and
you
will
soon
be
strong
if
you
could
remove
that
impression
from
your
mind
yes
yes
he
said
impatiently
but
i
don
t
want
to
get
strong
what
s
the
use
of
my
getting
well
it
would
be
better
for
me
if
i
die
and
it
would
certainly
be
better
for
eustacia
is
eustacia
there
yes
it
would
be
better
for
you
eustacia
if
i
were
to
die
don
t
press
such
a
question
dear
clym
well
it
really
is
but
a
shadowy
supposition
for
unfortunately
i
am
going
to
live
i
feel
myself
getting
better
thomasin
how
long
are
you
going
to
stay
at
the
inn
now
that
all
this
money
has
come
to
your
husband
another
month
or
two
probably
until
my
illness
is
over
we
cannot
get
off
till
then
i
think
it
will
be
a
month
or
more
yes
yes
of
course
ah
cousin
tamsie
you
will
get
over
your
trouble
one
little
month
will
take
you
through
it
and
bring
something
to
console
you
but
i
shall
never
get
over
mine
and
no
consolation
will
come
clym
you
are
unjust
to
yourself
depend
upon
it
aunt
thought
kindly
of
you
i
know
that
if
she
had
lived
you
would
have
been
reconciled
with
her
but
she
didn
t
come
to
see
me
though
i
asked
her
before
i
married
if
she
would
come
had
she
come
or
had
i
gone
there
she
would
never
have
died
saying
i
am
a
broken
hearted
woman
cast
off
by
my
son
my
door
has
always
been
open
to
her
a
welcome
here
has
always
awaited
her
but
that
she
never
came
to
see
you
had
better
not
talk
any
more
now
clym
said
eustacia
faintly
from
the
other
part
of
the
room
for
the
scene
was
growing
intolerable
to
her
let
me
talk
to
you
instead
for
the
little
time
i
shall
be
here
thomasin
said
soothingly
consider
what
a
one
sided
way
you
have
of
looking
at
the
matter
clym
when
she
said
that
to
the
little
boy
you
had
not
found
her
and
taken
her
into
your
arms
and
it
might
have
been
uttered
in
a
moment
of
bitterness
it
was
rather
like
aunt
to
say
things
in
haste
she
sometimes
used
to
speak
so
to
me
though
she
did
not
come
i
am
convinced
that
she
thought
of
coming
to
see
you
do
you
suppose
a
man
s
mother
could
live
two
or
three
months
without
one
forgiving
thought
she
forgave
me
and
why
should
she
not
have
forgiven
you
you
laboured
to
win
her
round
i
did
nothing
i
who
was
going
to
teach
people
the
higher
secrets
of
happiness
did
not
know
how
to
keep
out
of
that
gross
misery
which
the
most
untaught
are
wise
enough
to
avoid
how
did
you
get
here
tonight
thomasin
said
eustacia
damon
set
me
down
at
the
end
of
the
lane
he
has
driven
into
east
egdon
on
business
and
he
will
come
and
pick
me
up
by
and
by
accordingly
they
soon
after
heard
the
noise
of
wheels
wildeve
had
come
and
was
waiting
outside
with
his
horse
and
gig
send
out
and
tell
him
i
will
be
down
in
two
minutes
said
thomasin
i
will
run
down
myself
said
eustacia
she
went
down
wildeve
had
alighted
and
was
standing
before
the
horse
s
head
when
eustacia
opened
the
door
he
did
not
turn
for
a
moment
thinking
the
comer
thomasin
then
he
looked
startled
ever
so
little
and
said
one
word
well
i
have
not
yet
told
him
she
replied
in
a
whisper
then
don
t
do
so
till
he
is
well
it
will
be
fatal
you
are
ill
yourself
i
am
wretched
o
damon
she
said
bursting
into
tears
i
i
can
t
tell
you
how
unhappy
i
am
i
can
hardly
bear
this
i
can
tell
nobody
of
my
trouble
nobody
knows
of
it
but
you
poor
girl
said
wildeve
visibly
affected
at
her
distress
and
at
last
led
on
so
far
as
to
take
her
hand
it
is
hard
when
you
have
done
nothing
to
deserve
it
that
you
should
have
got
involved
in
such
a
web
as
this
you
were
not
made
for
these
sad
scenes
i
am
to
blame
most
if
i
could
only
have
saved
you
from
it
all
but
damon
please
pray
tell
me
what
i
must
do
to
sit
by
him
hour
after
hour
and
hear
him
reproach
himself
as
being
the
cause
of
her
death
and
to
know
that
i
am
the
sinner
if
any
human
being
is
at
all
drives
me
into
cold
despair
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
should
i
tell
him
or
should
i
not
tell
him
i
always
am
asking
myself
that
o
i
want
to
tell
him
and
yet
i
am
afraid
if
he
finds
it
out
he
must
surely
kill
me
for
nothing
else
will
be
in
proportion
to
his
feelings
now
beware
the
fury
of
a
patient
man
sounds
day
by
day
in
my
ears
as
i
watch
him
well
wait
till
he
is
better
and
trust
to
chance
and
when
you
tell
you
must
only
tell
part
for
his
own
sake
which
part
should
i
keep
back
wildeve
paused
that
i
was
in
the
house
at
the
time
he
said
in
a
low
tone
yes
it
must
be
concealed
seeing
what
has
been
whispered
how
much
easier
are
hasty
actions
than
speeches
that
will
excuse
them
if
he
were
only
to
die
wildeve
murmured
do
not
think
of
it
i
would
not
buy
hope
of
immunity
by
so
cowardly
a
desire
even
if
i
hated
him
now
i
am
going
up
to
him
again
thomasin
bade
me
tell
you
she
would
be
down
in
a
few
minutes
good
bye
she
returned
and
thomasin
soon
appeared
when
she
was
seated
in
the
gig
with
her
husband
and
the
horse
was
turning
to
go
off
wildeve
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
bedroom
windows
looking
from
one
of
them
he
could
discern
a
pale
tragic
face
watching
him
drive
away
it
was
eustacia
s
a
lurid
light
breaks
in
upon
a
darkened
understanding
clym
s
grief
became
mitigated
by
wearing
itself
out
his
strength
returned
and
a
month
after
the
visit
of
thomasin
he
might
have
been
seen
walking
about
the
garden
endurance
and
despair
equanimity
and
gloom
the
tints
of
health
and
the
pallor
of
death
mingled
weirdly
in
his
face
he
was
now
unnaturally
silent
upon
all
of
the
past
that
related
to
his
mother
and
though
eustacia
knew
that
he
was
thinking
of
it
none
the
less
she
was
only
too
glad
to
escape
the
topic
ever
to
bring
it
up
anew
when
his
mind
had
been
weaker
his
heart
had
led
him
to
speak
out
but
reason
having
now
somewhat
recovered
itself
he
sank
into
taciturnity
one
evening
when
he
was
thus
standing
in
the
garden
abstractedly
spudding
up
a
weed
with
his
stick
a
bony
figure
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
and
came
up
to
him
christian
isn
t
it
said
clym
i
am
glad
you
have
found
me
out
i
shall
soon
want
you
to
go
to
blooms
end
and
assist
me
in
putting
the
house
in
order
i
suppose
it
is
all
locked
up
as
i
left
it
yes
mister
clym
have
you
dug
up
the
potatoes
and
other
roots
yes
without
a
drop
o
rain
thank
god
but
i
was
coming
to
tell
ee
of
something
else
which
is
quite
different
from
what
we
have
lately
had
in
the
family
i
am
sent
by
the
rich
gentleman
at
the
woman
that
we
used
to
call
the
landlord
to
tell
ee
that
mrs
wildeve
is
doing
well
of
a
girl
which
was
born
punctually
at
one
o
clock
at
noon
or
a
few
minutes
more
or
less
and
tis
said
that
expecting
of
this
increase
is
what
have
kept
em
there
since
they
came
into
their
money
and
she
is
getting
on
well
you
say
yes
sir
only
mr
wildeve
is
twanky
because
tisn
t
a
boy
that
s
what
they
say
in
the
kitchen
but
i
was
not
supposed
to
notice
that
christian
now
listen
to
me
yes
sure
mr
yeobright
did
you
see
my
mother
the
day
before
she
died
no
i
did
not
yeobright
s
face
expressed
disappointment
but
i
zeed
her
the
morning
of
the
same
day
she
died
clym
s
look
lighted
up
that
s
nearer
still
to
my
meaning
he
said
yes
i
know
twas
the
same
day
for
she
said
i
be
going
to
see
him
christian
so
i
shall
not
want
any
vegetables
brought
in
for
dinner
see
whom
see
you
she
was
going
to
your
house
you
understand
yeobright
regarded
christian
with
intense
surprise
why
did
you
never
mention
this
he
said
are
you
sure
it
was
my
house
she
was
coming
to
o
yes
i
didn
t
mention
it
because
i
ve
never
zeed
you
lately
and
as
she
didn
t
get
there
it
was
all
nought
and
nothing
to
tell
and
i
have
been
wondering
why
she
should
have
walked
in
the
heath
on
that
hot
day
well
did
she
say
what
she
was
coming
for
it
is
a
thing
christian
i
am
very
anxious
to
know
yes
mister
clym
she
didn
t
say
it
to
me
though
i
think
she
did
to
one
here
and
there
do
you
know
one
person
to
whom
she
spoke
of
it
there
is
one
man
please
sir
but
i
hope
you
won
t
mention
my
name
to
him
as
i
have
seen
him
in
strange
places
particular
in
dreams
one
night
last
summer
he
glared
at
me
like
famine
and
sword
and
it
made
me
feel
so
low
that
i
didn
t
comb
out
my
few
hairs
for
two
days
he
was
standing
as
it
might
be
mister
yeobright
in
the
middle
of
the
path
to
mistover
and
your
mother
came
up
looking
as
pale
yes
when
was
that
last
summer
in
my
dream
pooh
who
s
the
man
diggory
the
reddleman
he
called
upon
her
and
sat
with
her
the
evening
before
she
set
out
to
see
you
i
hadn
t
gone
home
from
work
when
he
came
up
to
the
gate
i
must
see
venn
i
wish
i
had
known
it
before
said
clym
anxiously
i
wonder
why
he
has
not
come
to
tell
me
he
went
out
of
egdon
heath
the
next
day
so
would
not
be
likely
to
know
you
wanted
him
christian
said
clym
you
must
go
and
find
venn
i
am
otherwise
engaged
or
i
would
go
myself
find
him
at
once
and
tell
him
i
want
to
speak
to
him
i
am
a
good
hand
at
hunting
up
folk
by
day
said
christian
looking
dubiously
round
at
the
declining
light
but
as
to
night
time
never
is
such
a
bad
hand
as
i
mister
yeobright
search
the
heath
when
you
will
so
that
you
bring
him
soon
bring
him
tomorrow
if
you
can
christian
then
departed
the
morrow
came
but
no
venn
in
the
evening
christian
arrived
looking
very
weary
he
had
been
searching
all
day
and
had
heard
nothing
of
the
reddleman
inquire
as
much
as
you
can
tomorrow
without
neglecting
your
work
said
yeobright
don
t
come
again
till
you
have
found
him
the
next
day
yeobright
set
out
for
the
old
house
at
blooms
end
which
with
the
garden
was
now
his
own
his
severe
illness
had
hindered
all
preparations
for
his
removal
thither
but
it
had
become
necessary
that
he
should
go
and
overlook
its
contents
as
administrator
to
his
mother
s
little
property
for
which
purpose
he
decided
to
pass
the
next
night
on
the
premises
he
journeyed
onward
not
quickly
or
decisively
but
in
the
slow
walk
of
one
who
has
been
awakened
from
a
stupefying
sleep
it
was
early
afternoon
when
he
reached
the
valley
the
expression
of
the
place
the
tone
of
the
hour
were
precisely
those
of
many
such
occasions
in
days
gone
by
and
these
antecedent
similarities
fostered
the
illusion
that
she
who
was
there
no
longer
would
come
out
to
welcome
him
the
garden
gate
was
locked
and
the
shutters
were
closed
just
as
he
himself
had
left
them
on
the
evening
after
the
funeral
he
unlocked
the
gate
and
found
that
a
spider
had
already
constructed
a
large
web
tying
the
door
to
the
lintel
on
the
supposition
that
it
was
never
to
be
opened
again
when
he
had
entered
the
house
and
flung
back
the
shutters
he
set
about
his
task
of
overhauling
the
cupboards
and
closets
burning
papers
and
considering
how
best
to
arrange
the
place
for
eustacia
s
reception
until
such
time
as
he
might
be
in
a
position
to
carry
out
his
long
delayed
scheme
should
that
time
ever
arrive
as
he
surveyed
the
rooms
he
felt
strongly
disinclined
for
the
alterations
which
would
have
to
be
made
in
the
time
honoured
furnishing
of
his
parents
and
grandparents
to
suit
eustacia
s
modern
ideas
the
gaunt
oak
cased
clock
with
the
picture
of
the
ascension
on
the
door
panel
and
the
miraculous
draught
of
fishes
on
the
base
his
grandmother
s
corner
cupboard
with
the
glass
door
through
which
the
spotted
china
was
visible
the
dumb
waiter
the
wooden
tea
trays
the
hanging
fountain
with
the
brass
tap
whither
would
these
venerable
articles
have
to
be
banished
he
noticed
that
the
flowers
in
the
window
had
died
for
want
of
water
and
he
placed
them
out
upon
the
ledge
that
they
might
be
taken
away
while
thus
engaged
he
heard
footsteps
on
the
gravel
without
and
somebody
knocked
at
the
door
yeobright
opened
it
and
venn
was
standing
before
him
good
morning
said
the
reddleman
is
mrs
yeobright
at
home
yeobright
looked
upon
the
ground
then
you
have
not
seen
christian
or
any
of
the
egdon
folks
he
said
no
i
have
only
just
returned
after
a
long
stay
away
i
called
here
the
day
before
i
left
and
you
have
heard
nothing
nothing
my
mother
is
dead
dead
said
venn
mechanically
her
home
now
is
where
i
shouldn
t
mind
having
mine
venn
regarded
him
and
then
said
if
i
didn
t
see
your
face
i
could
never
believe
your
words
have
you
been
ill
i
had
an
illness
well
the
change
when
i
parted
from
her
a
month
ago
everything
seemed
to
say
that
she
was
going
to
begin
a
new
life
and
what
seemed
came
true
you
say
right
no
doubt
trouble
has
taught
you
a
deeper
vein
of
talk
than
mine
all
i
meant
was
regarding
her
life
here
she
has
died
too
soon
perhaps
through
my
living
too
long
i
have
had
a
bitter
experience
on
that
score
this
last
month
diggory
but
come
in
i
have
been
wanting
to
see
you
he
conducted
the
reddleman
into
the
large
room
where
the
dancing
had
taken
place
the
previous
christmas
and
they
sat
down
in
the
settle
together
there
s
the
cold
fireplace
you
see
said
clym
when
that
half
burnt
log
and
those
cinders
were
alight
she
was
alive
little
has
been
changed
here
yet
i
can
do
nothing
my
life
creeps
like
a
snail
how
came
she
to
die
said
venn
yeobright
gave
him
some
particulars
of
her
illness
and
death
and
continued
after
this
no
kind
of
pain
will
ever
seem
more
than
an
indisposition
to
me
i
began
saying
that
i
wanted
to
ask
you
something
but
i
stray
from
subjects
like
a
drunken
man
i
am
anxious
to
know
what
my
mother
said
to
you
when
she
last
saw
you
you
talked
with
her
a
long
time
i
think
i
talked
with
her
more
than
half
an
hour
about
me
yes
and
it
must
have
been
on
account
of
what
we
said
that
she
was
on
the
heath
without
question
she
was
coming
to
see
you
but
why
should
she
come
to
see
me
if
she
felt
so
bitterly
against
me
there
s
the
mystery
yet
i
know
she
quite
forgave
ee
but
diggory
would
a
woman
who
had
quite
forgiven
her
son
say
when
she
felt
herself
ill
on
the
way
to
his
house
that
she
was
broken
hearted
because
of
his
ill
usage
never
what
i
know
is
that
she
didn
t
blame
you
at
all
she
blamed
herself
for
what
had
happened
and
only
herself
i
had
it
from
her
own
lips
you
had
it
from
her
lips
that
i
had
not
ill
treated
her
and
at
the
same
time
another
had
it
from
her
lips
that
i
had
ill
treated
her
my
mother
was
no
impulsive
woman
who
changed
her
opinion
every
hour
without
reason
how
can
it
be
venn
that
she
should
have
told
such
different
stories
in
close
succession
i
cannot
say
it
is
certainly
odd
when
she
had
forgiven
you
and
had
forgiven
your
wife
and
was
going
to
see
ye
on
purpose
to
make
friends
if
there
was
one
thing
wanting
to
bewilder
me
it
was
this
incomprehensible
thing
diggory
if
we
who
remain
alive
were
only
allowed
to
hold
conversation
with
the
dead
just
once
a
bare
minute
even
through
a
screen
of
iron
bars
as
with
persons
in
prison
what
we
might
learn
how
many
who
now
ride
smiling
would
hide
their
heads
and
this
mystery
i
should
then
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
at
once
but
the
grave
has
forever
shut
her
in
and
how
shall
it
be
found
out
now
no
reply
was
returned
by
his
companion
since
none
could
be
given
and
when
venn
left
a
few
minutes
later
clym
had
passed
from
the
dullness
of
sorrow
to
the
fluctuation
of
carking
incertitude
he
continued
in
the
same
state
all
the
afternoon
a
bed
was
made
up
for
him
in
the
same
house
by
a
neighbour
that
he
might
not
have
to
return
again
the
next
day
and
when
he
retired
to
rest
in
the
deserted
place
it
was
only
to
remain
awake
hour
after
hour
thinking
the
same
thoughts
how
to
discover
a
solution
to
this
riddle
of
death
seemed
a
query
of
more
importance
than
highest
problems
of
the
living
there
was
housed
in
his
memory
a
vivid
picture
of
the
face
of
a
little
boy
as
he
entered
the
hovel
where
clym
s
mother
lay
the
round
eyes
eager
gaze
the
piping
voice
which
enunciated
the
words
had
operated
like
stilettos
on
his
brain
a
visit
to
the
boy
suggested
itself
as
a
means
of
gleaning
new
particulars
though
it
might
be
quite
unproductive
to
probe
a
child
s
mind
after
the
lapse
of
six
weeks
not
for
facts
which
the
child
had
seen
and
understood
but
to
get
at
those
which
were
in
their
nature
beyond
him
did
not
promise
much
yet
when
every
obvious
channel
is
blocked
we
grope
towards
the
small
and
obscure
there
was
nothing
else
left
to
do
after
that
he
would
allow
the
enigma
to
drop
into
the
abyss
of
undiscoverable
things
it
was
about
daybreak
when
he
had
reached
this
decision
and
he
at
once
arose
he
locked
up
the
house
and
went
out
into
the
green
patch
which
merged
in
heather
further
on
in
front
of
the
white
garden
palings
the
path
branched
into
three
like
a
broad
arrow
the
road
to
the
right
led
to
the
quiet
woman
and
its
neighbourhood
the
middle
track
led
to
mistover
knap
the
left
hand
track
led
over
the
hill
to
another
part
of
mistover
where
the
child
lived
on
inclining
into
the
latter
path
yeobright
felt
a
creeping
chilliness
familiar
enough
to
most
people
and
probably
caused
by
the
unsunned
morning
air
in
after
days
he
thought
of
it
as
a
thing
of
singular
significance
when
yeobright
reached
the
cottage
of
susan
nunsuch
the
mother
of
the
boy
he
sought
he
found
that
the
inmates
were
not
yet
astir
but
in
upland
hamlets
the
transition
from
a
bed
to
abroad
is
surprisingly
swift
and
easy
there
no
dense
partition
of
yawns
and
toilets
divides
humanity
by
night
from
humanity
by
day
yeobright
tapped
at
the
upper
windowsill
which
he
could
reach
with
his
walking
stick
and
in
three
or
four
minutes
the
woman
came
down
it
was
not
till
this
moment
that
clym
recollected
her
to
be
the
person
who
had
behaved
so
barbarously
to
eustacia
it
partly
explained
the
insuavity
with
which
the
woman
greeted
him
moreover
the
boy
had
been
ailing
again
and
susan
now
as
ever
since
the
night
when
he
had
been
pressed
into
eustacia
s
service
at
the
bonfire
attributed
his
indispositions
to
eustacia
s
influence
as
a
witch
it
was
one
of
those
sentiments
which
lurk
like
moles
underneath
the
visible
surface
of
manners
and
may
have
been
kept
alive
by
eustacia
s
entreaty
to
the
captain
at
the
time
that
he
had
intended
to
prosecute
susan
for
the
pricking
in
church
to
let
the
matter
drop
which
he
accordingly
had
done
yeobright
overcame
his
repugnance
for
susan
had
at
least
borne
his
mother
no
ill
will
he
asked
kindly
for
the
boy
but
her
manner
did
not
improve
i
wish
to
see
him
continued
yeobright
with
some
hesitation
to
ask
him
if
he
remembers
anything
more
of
his
walk
with
my
mother
than
what
he
has
previously
told
she
regarded
him
in
a
peculiar
and
criticizing
manner
to
anybody
but
a
half
blind
man
it
would
have
said
you
want
another
of
the
knocks
which
have
already
laid
you
so
low
she
called
the
boy
downstairs
asked
clym
to
sit
down
on
a
stool
and
continued
now
johnny
tell
mr
yeobright
anything
you
can
call
to
mind
you
have
not
forgotten
how
you
walked
with
the
poor
lady
on
that
hot
day
said
clym
no
said
the
boy
and
what
she
said
to
you
the
boy
repeated
the
exact
words
he
had
used
on
entering
the
hut
yeobright
rested
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
shaded
his
face
with
his
hand
and
the
mother
looked
as
if
she
wondered
how
a
man
could
want
more
of
what
had
stung
him
so
deeply
she
was
going
to
alderworth
when
you
first
met
her
no
she
was
coming
away
that
can
t
be
yes
she
walked
along
with
me
i
was
coming
away
too
then
where
did
you
first
see
her
at
your
house
attend
and
speak
the
truth
said
clym
sternly
yes
sir
at
your
house
was
where
i
seed
her
first
clym
started
up
and
susan
smiled
in
an
expectant
way
which
did
not
embellish
her
face
it
seemed
to
mean
something
sinister
is
coming
what
did
she
do
at
my
house
she
went
and
sat
under
the
trees
at
the
devil
s
bellows
good
god
this
is
all
news
to
me
you
never
told
me
this
before
said
susan
no
mother
because
i
didn
t
like
to
tell
ee
i
had
been
so
far
i
was
picking
blackhearts
and
went
further
than
i
meant
what
did
she
do
then
said
yeobright
looked
at
a
man
who
came
up
and
went
into
your
house
that
was
myself
a
furze
cutter
with
brambles
in
his
hand
no
twas
not
you
twas
a
gentleman
you
had
gone
in
afore
who
was
he
i
don
t
know
now
tell
me
what
happened
next
the
poor
lady
went
and
knocked
at
your
door
and
the
lady
with
black
hair
looked
out
of
the
side
window
at
her
the
boy
s
mother
turned
to
clym
and
said
this
is
something
you
didn
t
expect
yeobright
took
no
more
notice
of
her
than
if
he
had
been
of
stone
go
on
go
on
he
said
hoarsely
to
the
boy
and
when
she
saw
the
young
lady
look
out
of
the
window
the
old
lady
knocked
again
and
when
nobody
came
she
took
up
the
furze
hook
and
looked
at
it
and
put
it
down
again
and
then
she
looked
at
the
faggot
bonds
and
then
she
went
away
and
walked
across
to
me
and
blowed
her
breath
very
hard
like
this
we
walked
on
together
she
and
i
and
i
talked
to
her
and
she
talked
to
me
a
bit
but
not
much
because
she
couldn
t
blow
her
breath
o
murmured
clym
in
a
low
tone
and
bowed
his
head
let
s
have
more
he
said
she
couldn
t
talk
much
and
she
couldn
t
walk
and
her
face
was
o
so
queer
how
was
her
face
like
yours
is
now
the
woman
looked
at
yeobright
and
beheld
him
colourless
in
a
cold
sweat
isn
t
there
meaning
in
it
she
said
stealthily
what
do
you
think
of
her
now
silence
said
clym
fiercely
and
turning
to
the
boy
and
then
you
left
her
to
die
no
said
the
woman
quickly
and
angrily
he
did
not
leave
her
to
die
she
sent
him
away
whoever
says
he
forsook
her
says
what
s
not
true
trouble
no
more
about
that
answered
clym
with
a
quivering
mouth
what
he
did
is
a
trifle
in
comparison
with
what
he
saw
door
kept
shut
did
you
say
kept
shut
she
looking
out
of
window
good
heart
of
god
what
does
it
mean
the
child
shrank
away
from
the
gaze
of
his
questioner
he
said
so
answered
the
mother
and
johnny
s
a
god
fearing
boy
and
tells
no
lies
cast
off
by
my
son
no
by
my
best
life
dear
mother
it
is
not
so
but
by
your
son
s
your
son
s
may
all
murderesses
get
the
torment
they
deserve
with
these
words
yeobright
went
forth
from
the
little
dwelling
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
fixed
steadfastly
on
blankness
were
vaguely
lit
with
an
icy
shine
his
mouth
had
passed
into
the
phase
more
or
less
imaginatively
rendered
in
studies
of
oedipus
the
strangest
deeds
were
possible
to
his
mood
but
they
were
not
possible
to
his
situation
instead
of
there
being
before
him
the
pale
face
of
eustacia
and
a
masculine
shape
unknown
there
was
only
the
imperturbable
countenance
of
the
heath
which
having
defied
the
cataclysmal
onsets
of
centuries
reduced
to
insignificance
by
its
seamed
and
antique
features
the
wildest
turmoil
of
a
single
man
eustacia
dresses
herself
on
a
black
morning
a
consciousness
of
a
vast
impassivity
in
all
which
lay
around
him
took
possession
even
of
yeobright
in
his
wild
walk
towards
alderworth
he
had
once
before
felt
in
his
own
person
this
overpowering
of
the
fervid
by
the
inanimate
but
then
it
had
tended
to
enervate
a
passion
far
sweeter
than
that
which
at
present
pervaded
him
it
was
once
when
he
stood
parting
from
eustacia
in
the
moist
still
levels
beyond
the
hills
but
dismissing
all
this
he
went
onward
home
and
came
to
the
front
of
his
house
the
blinds
of
eustacia
s
bedroom
were
still
closely
drawn
for
she
was
no
early
riser
all
the
life
visible
was
in
the
shape
of
a
solitary
thrush
cracking
a
small
snail
upon
the
door
stone
for
his
breakfast
and
his
tapping
seemed
a
loud
noise
in
the
general
silence
which
prevailed
but
on
going
to
the
door
clym
found
it
unfastened
the
young
girl
who
attended
upon
eustacia
being
astir
in
the
back
part
of
the
premises
yeobright
entered
and
went
straight
to
his
wife
s
room
the
noise
of
his
arrival
must
have
aroused
her
for
when
he
opened
the
door
she
was
standing
before
the
looking
glass
in
her
nightdress
the
ends
of
her
hair
gathered
into
one
hand
with
which
she
was
coiling
the
whole
mass
round
her
head
previous
to
beginning
toilette
operations
she
was
not
a
woman
given
to
speaking
first
at
a
meeting
and
she
allowed
clym
to
walk
across
in
silence
without
turning
her
head
he
came
behind
her
and
she
saw
his
face
in
the
glass
it
was
ashy
haggard
and
terrible
instead
of
starting
towards
him
in
sorrowful
surprise
as
even
eustacia
undemonstrative
wife
as
she
was
would
have
done
in
days
before
she
burdened
herself
with
a
secret
she
remained
motionless
looking
at
him
in
the
glass
and
while
she
looked
the
carmine
flush
with
which
warmth
and
sound
sleep
had
suffused
her
cheeks
and
neck
dissolved
from
view
and
the
deathlike
pallor
in
his
face
flew
across
into
hers
he
was
close
enough
to
see
this
and
the
sight
instigated
his
tongue
you
know
what
is
the
matter
he
said
huskily
i
see
it
in
your
face
her
hand
relinquished
the
rope
of
hair
and
dropped
to
her
side
and
the
pile
of
tresses
no
longer
supported
fell
from
the
crown
of
her
head
about
her
shoulders
and
over
the
white
nightgown
she
made
no
reply
speak
to
me
said
yeobright
peremptorily
the
blanching
process
did
not
cease
in
her
and
her
lips
now
became
as
white
as
her
face
she
turned
to
him
and
said
yes
clym
i
ll
speak
to
you
why
do
you
return
so
early
can
i
do
anything
for
you
yes
you
can
listen
to
me
it
seems
that
my
wife
is
not
very
well
why
your
face
my
dear
your
face
or
perhaps
it
is
the
pale
morning
light
which
takes
your
colour
away
now
i
am
going
to
reveal
a
secret
to
you
ha
ha
o
that
is
ghastly
what
your
laugh
there
s
reason
for
ghastliness
eustacia
you
have
held
my
happiness
in
the
hollow
of
your
hand
and
like
a
devil
you
have
dashed
it
down
she
started
back
from
the
dressing
table
retreated
a
few
steps
from
him
and
looked
him
in
the
face
ah
you
think
to
frighten
me
she
said
with
a
slight
laugh
is
it
worth
while
i
am
undefended
and
alone
how
extraordinary
what
do
you
mean
as
there
is
ample
time
i
will
tell
you
though
you
know
well
enough
i
mean
that
it
is
extraordinary
that
you
should
be
alone
in
my
absence
tell
me
now
where
is
he
who
was
with
you
on
the
afternoon
of
the
thirty
first
of
august
under
the
bed
up
the
chimney
a
shudder
overcame
her
and
shook
the
light
fabric
of
her
nightdress
throughout
i
do
not
remember
dates
so
exactly
she
said
i
cannot
recollect
that
anybody
was
with
me
besides
yourself
the
day
i
mean
said
yeobright
his
voice
growing
louder
and
harsher
was
the
day
you
shut
the
door
against
my
mother
and
killed
her
o
it
is
too
much
too
bad
he
leant
over
the
footpiece
of
the
bedstead
for
a
few
moments
with
his
back
towards
her
then
rising
again
tell
me
tell
me
tell
me
do
you
hear
he
cried
rushing
up
to
her
and
seizing
her
by
the
loose
folds
of
her
sleeve
the
superstratum
of
timidity
which
often
overlies
those
who
are
daring
and
defiant
at
heart
had
been
passed
through
and
the
mettlesome
substance
of
the
woman
was
reached
the
red
blood
inundated
her
face
previously
so
pale
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
said
in
a
low
voice
regarding
him
with
a
proud
smile
you
will
not
alarm
me
by
holding
on
so
but
it
would
be
a
pity
to
tear
my
sleeve
instead
of
letting
go
he
drew
her
closer
to
him
tell
me
the
particulars
of
my
mother
s
death
he
said
in
a
hard
panting
whisper
or
i
ll
i
ll
clym
she
answered
slowly
do
you
think
you
dare
do
anything
to
me
that
i
dare
not
bear
but
before
you
strike
me
listen
you
will
get
nothing
from
me
by
a
blow
even
though
it
should
kill
me
as
it
probably
will
but
perhaps
you
do
not
wish
me
to
speak
killing
may
be
all
you
mean
kill
you
do
you
expect
it
i
do
why
no
less
degree
of
rage
against
me
will
match
your
previous
grief
for
her
phew
i
shall
not
kill
you
he
said
contemptuously
as
if
under
a
sudden
change
of
purpose
i
did
think
of
it
but
i
shall
not
that
would
be
making
a
martyr
of
you
and
sending
you
to
where
she
is
and
i
would
keep
you
away
from
her
till
the
universe
come
to
an
end
if
i
could
i
almost
wish
you
would
kill
me
said
she
with
gloomy
bitterness
it
is
with
no
strong
desire
i
assure
you
that
i
play
the
part
i
have
lately
played
on
earth
you
are
no
blessing
my
husband
you
shut
the
door
you
looked
out
of
the
window
upon
her
you
had
a
man
in
the
house
with
you
you
sent
her
away
to
die
the
inhumanity
the
treachery
i
will
not
touch
you
stand
away
from
me
and
confess
every
word
never
i
ll
hold
my
tongue
like
the
very
death
that
i
don
t
mind
meeting
even
though
i
can
clear
myself
of
half
you
believe
by
speaking
yes
i
will
who
of
any
dignity
would
take
the
trouble
to
clear
cobwebs
from
a
wild
man
s
mind
after
such
language
as
this
no
let
him
go
on
and
think
his
narrow
thoughts
and
run
his
head
into
the
mire
i
have
other
cares
tis
too
much
but
i
must
spare
you
poor
charity
by
my
wretched
soul
you
sting
me
eustacia
i
can
keep
it
up
and
hotly
too
now
then
madam
tell
me
his
name
never
i
am
resolved
how
often
does
he
write
to
you
where
does
he
put
his
letters
when
does
he
meet
you
ah
his
letters
do
you
tell
me
his
name
i
do
not
then
i
ll
find
it
myself
his
eyes
had
fallen
upon
a
small
desk
that
stood
near
on
which
she
was
accustomed
to
write
her
letters
he
went
to
it
it
was
locked
unlock
this
you
have
no
right
to
say
it
that
s
mine
without
another
word
he
seized
the
desk
and
dashed
it
to
the
floor
the
hinge
burst
open
and
a
number
of
letters
tumbled
out
stay
said
eustacia
stepping
before
him
with
more
excitement
than
she
had
hitherto
shown
come
come
stand
away
i
must
see
them
she
looked
at
the
letters
as
they
lay
checked
her
feeling
and
moved
indifferently
aside
when
he
gathered
them
up
and
examined
them
by
no
stretch
of
meaning
could
any
but
a
harmless
construction
be
placed
upon
a
single
one
of
the
letters
themselves
the
solitary
exception
was
an
empty
envelope
directed
to
her
and
the
handwriting
was
wildeve
s
yeobright
held
it
up
eustacia
was
doggedly
silent
can
you
read
madam
look
at
this
envelope
doubtless
we
shall
find
more
soon
and
what
was
inside
them
i
shall
no
doubt
be
gratified
by
learning
in
good
time
what
a
well
finished
and
full
blown
adept
in
a
certain
trade
my
lady
is
do
you
say
it
to
me
do
you
she
gasped
he
searched
further
but
found
nothing
more
what
was
in
this
letter
he
said
ask
the
writer
am
i
your
hound
that
you
should
talk
to
me
in
this
way
do
you
brave
me
do
you
stand
me
out
mistress
answer
don
t
look
at
me
with
those
eyes
if
you
would
bewitch
me
again
sooner
than
that
i
die
you
refuse
to
answer
i
wouldn
t
tell
you
after
this
if
i
were
as
innocent
as
the
sweetest
babe
in
heaven
which
you
are
not
certainly
i
am
not
absolutely
she
replied
i
have
not
done
what
you
suppose
but
if
to
have
done
no
harm
at
all
is
the
only
innocence
recognized
i
am
beyond
forgiveness
but
i
require
no
help
from
your
conscience
you
can
resist
and
resist
again
instead
of
hating
you
i
could
i
think
mourn
for
and
pity
you
if
you
were
contrite
and
would
confess
all
forgive
you
i
never
can
i
don
t
speak
of
your
lover
i
will
give
you
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
in
that
matter
for
it
only
affects
me
personally
but
the
other
had
you
half
killed
me
had
it
been
that
you
wilfully
took
the
sight
away
from
these
feeble
eyes
of
mine
i
could
have
forgiven
you
but
that
s
too
much
for
nature
say
no
more
i
will
do
without
your
pity
but
i
would
have
saved
you
from
uttering
what
you
will
regret
i
am
going
away
now
i
shall
leave
you
you
need
not
go
as
i
am
going
myself
you
will
keep
just
as
far
away
from
me
by
staying
here
call
her
to
mind
think
of
her
what
goodness
there
was
in
her
it
showed
in
every
line
of
her
face
most
women
even
when
but
slightly
annoyed
show
a
flicker
of
evil
in
some
curl
of
the
mouth
or
some
corner
of
the
cheek
but
as
for
her
never
in
her
angriest
moments
was
there
anything
malicious
in
her
look
she
was
angered
quickly
but
she
forgave
just
as
readily
and
underneath
her
pride
there
was
the
meekness
of
a
child
what
came
of
it
what
cared
you
you
hated
her
just
as
she
was
learning
to
love
you
o
couldn
t
you
see
what
was
best
for
you
but
must
bring
a
curse
upon
me
and
agony
and
death
upon
her
by
doing
that
cruel
deed
what
was
the
fellow
s
name
who
was
keeping
you
company
and
causing
you
to
add
cruelty
to
her
to
your
wrong
to
me
was
it
wildeve
was
it
poor
thomasin
s
husband
heaven
what
wickedness
lost
your
voice
have
you
it
is
natural
after
detection
of
that
most
noble
trick
eustacia
didn
t
any
tender
thought
of
your
own
mother
lead
you
to
think
of
being
gentle
to
mine
at
such
a
time
of
weariness
did
not
one
grain
of
pity
enter
your
heart
as
she
turned
away
think
what
a
vast
opportunity
was
then
lost
of
beginning
a
forgiving
and
honest
course
why
did
not
you
kick
him
out
and
let
her
in
and
say
i
ll
be
an
honest
wife
and
a
noble
woman
from
this
hour
had
i
told
you
to
go
and
quench
eternally
our
last
flickering
chance
of
happiness
here
you
could
have
done
no
worse
well
she
s
asleep
now
and
have
you
a
hundred
gallants
neither
they
nor
you
can
insult
her
any
more
you
exaggerate
fearfully
she
said
in
a
faint
weary
voice
but
i
cannot
enter
into
my
defence
it
is
not
worth
doing
you
are
nothing
to
me
in
future
and
the
past
side
of
the
story
may
as
well
remain
untold
i
have
lost
all
through
you
but
i
have
not
complained
your
blunders
and
misfortunes
may
have
been
a
sorrow
to
you
but
they
have
been
a
wrong
to
me
all
persons
of
refinement
have
been
scared
away
from
me
since
i
sank
into
the
mire
of
marriage
is
this
your
cherishing
to
put
me
into
a
hut
like
this
and
keep
me
like
the
wife
of
a
hind
you
deceived
me
not
by
words
but
by
appearances
which
are
less
seen
through
than
words
but
the
place
will
serve
as
well
as
any
other
as
somewhere
to
pass
from
into
my
grave
her
words
were
smothered
in
her
throat
and
her
head
drooped
down
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
by
that
am
i
the
cause
of
your
sin
eustacia
made
a
trembling
motion
towards
him
what
you
can
begin
to
shed
tears
and
offer
me
your
hand
good
god
can
you
no
not
i
i
ll
not
commit
the
fault
of
taking
that
the
hand
she
had
offered
dropped
nervelessly
but
the
tears
continued
flowing
well
yes
i
ll
take
it
if
only
for
the
sake
of
my
own
foolish
kisses
that
were
wasted
there
before
i
knew
what
i
cherished
how
bewitched
i
was
how
could
there
be
any
good
in
a
woman
that
everybody
spoke
ill
of
o
o
o
she
cried
breaking
down
at
last
and
shaking
with
sobs
which
choked
her
she
sank
upon
her
knees
o
will
you
have
done
o
you
are
too
relentless
there
s
a
limit
to
the
cruelty
of
savages
i
have
held
out
long
but
you
crush
me
down
i
beg
for
mercy
i
cannot
bear
this
any
longer
it
is
inhuman
to
go
further
with
this
if
i
had
killed
your
mother
with
my
own
hand
i
should
not
deserve
such
a
scourging
to
the
bone
as
this
o
o
god
have
mercy
upon
a
miserable
woman
you
have
beaten
me
in
this
game
i
beg
you
to
stay
your
hand
in
pity
i
confess
that
i
wilfully
did
not
undo
the
door
the
first
time
she
knocked
but
i
should
have
unfastened
it
the
second
if
i
had
not
thought
you
had
gone
to
do
it
yourself
when
i
found
you
had
not
i
opened
it
but
she
was
gone
that
s
the
extent
of
my
crime
towards
her
best
natures
commit
bad
faults
sometimes
don
t
they
i
think
they
do
now
i
will
leave
you
for
ever
and
ever
tell
all
and
i
will
pity
you
was
the
man
in
the
house
with
you
wildeve
i
cannot
tell
she
said
desperately
through
her
sobbing
don
t
insist
further
i
cannot
tell
i
am
going
from
this
house
we
cannot
both
stay
here
you
need
not
go
i
will
go
you
can
stay
here
no
i
will
dress
and
then
i
will
go
where
where
i
came
from
or
elsewhere
she
hastily
dressed
herself
yeobright
moodily
walking
up
and
down
the
room
the
whole
of
the
time
at
last
all
her
things
were
on
her
little
hands
quivered
so
violently
as
she
held
them
to
her
chin
to
fasten
her
bonnet
that
she
could
not
tie
the
strings
and
after
a
few
moments
she
relinquished
the
attempt
seeing
this
he
moved
forward
and
said
let
me
tie
them
she
assented
in
silence
and
lifted
her
chin
for
once
at
least
in
her
life
she
was
totally
oblivious
of
the
charm
of
her
attitude
but
he
was
not
and
he
turned
his
eyes
aside
that
he
might
not
be
tempted
to
softness
the
strings
were
tied
she
turned
from
him
do
you
still
prefer
going
away
yourself
to
my
leaving
you
he
inquired
again
i
do
very
well
let
it
be
and
when
you
will
confess
to
the
man
i
may
pity
you
she
flung
her
shawl
about
her
and
went
downstairs
leaving
him
standing
in
the
room
eustacia
had
not
long
been
gone
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
of
the
bedroom
and
yeobright
said
well
it
was
the
servant
and
she
replied
somebody
from
mrs
wildeve
s
have
called
to
tell
ee
that
the
mis
ess
and
the
baby
are
getting
on
wonderful
well
and
the
baby
s
name
is
to
be
eustacia
clementine
and
the
girl
retired
what
a
mockery
said
clym
this
unhappy
marriage
of
mine
to
be
perpetuated
in
that
child
s
name
the
ministrations
of
a
half
forgotten
one
eustacia
s
journey
was
at
first
as
vague
in
direction
as
that
of
thistledown
on
the
wind
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
she
wished
it
had
been
night
instead
of
morning
that
she
might
at
least
have
borne
her
misery
without
the
possibility
of
being
seen
tracing
mile
after
mile
along
between
the
dying
ferns
and
the
wet
white
spiders
webs
she
at
length
turned
her
steps
towards
her
grandfather
s
house
she
found
the
front
door
closed
and
locked
mechanically
she
went
round
to
the
end
where
the
stable
was
and
on
looking
in
at
the
stable
door
she
saw
charley
standing
within
captain
vye
is
not
at
home
she
said
no
ma
am
said
the
lad
in
a
flutter
of
feeling
he
s
gone
to
weatherbury
and
won
t
be
home
till
night
and
the
servant
is
gone
home
for
a
holiday
so
the
house
is
locked
up
eustacia
s
face
was
not
visible
to
charley
as
she
stood
at
the
doorway
her
back
being
to
the
sky
and
the
stable
but
indifferently
lighted
but
the
wildness
of
her
manner
arrested
his
attention
she
turned
and
walked
away
across
the
enclosure
to
the
gate
and
was
hidden
by
the
bank
when
she
had
disappeared
charley
with
misgiving
in
his
eyes
slowly
came
from
the
stable
door
and
going
to
another
point
in
the
bank
he
looked
over
eustacia
was
leaning
against
it
on
the
outside
her
face
covered
with
her
hands
and
her
head
pressing
the
dewy
heather
which
bearded
the
bank
s
outer
side
she
appeared
to
be
utterly
indifferent
to
the
circumstance
that
her
bonnet
hair
and
garments
were
becoming
wet
and
disarranged
by
the
moisture
of
her
cold
harsh
pillow
clearly
something
was
wrong
charley
had
always
regarded
eustacia
as
eustacia
had
regarded
clym
when
she
first
beheld
him
as
a
romantic
and
sweet
vision
scarcely
incarnate
he
had
been
so
shut
off
from
her
by
the
dignity
of
her
look
and
the
pride
of
her
speech
except
at
that
one
blissful
interval
when
he
was
allowed
to
hold
her
hand
that
he
had
hardly
deemed
her
a
woman
wingless
and
earthly
subject
to
household
conditions
and
domestic
jars
the
inner
details
of
her
life
he
had
only
conjectured
she
had
been
a
lovely
wonder
predestined
to
an
orbit
in
which
the
whole
of
his
own
was
but
a
point
and
this
sight
of
her
leaning
like
a
helpless
despairing
creature
against
a
wild
wet
bank
filled
him
with
an
amazed
horror
he
could
no
longer
remain
where
he
was
leaping
over
he
came
up
touched
her
with
his
finger
and
said
tenderly
you
are
poorly
ma
am
what
can
i
do
eustacia
started
up
and
said
ah
charley
you
have
followed
me
you
did
not
think
when
i
left
home
in
the
summer
that
i
should
come
back
like
this
i
did
not
dear
ma
am
can
i
help
you
now
i
am
afraid
not
i
wish
i
could
get
into
the
house
i
feel
giddy
that
s
all
lean
on
my
arm
ma
am
till
we
get
to
the
porch
and
i
will
try
to
open
the
door
he
supported
her
to
the
porch
and
there
depositing
her
on
a
seat
hastened
to
the
back
climbed
to
a
window
by
the
help
of
a
ladder
and
descending
inside
opened
the
door
next
he
assisted
her
into
the
room
where
there
was
an
old
fashioned
horsehair
settee
as
large
as
a
donkey
wagon
she
lay
down
here
and
charley
covered
her
with
a
cloak
he
found
in
the
hall
shall
i
get
you
something
to
eat
and
drink
he
said
if
you
please
charley
but
i
suppose
there
is
no
fire
i
can
light
it
ma
am
he
vanished
and
she
heard
a
splitting
of
wood
and
a
blowing
of
bellows
and
presently
he
returned
saying
i
have
lighted
a
fire
in
the
kitchen
and
now
i
ll
light
one
here
he
lit
the
fire
eustacia
dreamily
observing
him
from
her
couch
when
it
was
blazing
up
he
said
shall
i
wheel
you
round
in
front
of
it
ma
am
as
the
morning
is
chilly
yes
if
you
like
shall
i
go
and
bring
the
victuals
now
yes
do
she
murmured
languidly
when
he
had
gone
and
the
dull
sounds
occasionally
reached
her
ears
of
his
movements
in
the
kitchen
she
forgot
where
she
was
and
had
for
a
moment
to
consider
by
an
effort
what
the
sounds
meant
after
an
interval
which
seemed
short
to
her
whose
thoughts
were
elsewhere
he
came
in
with
a
tray
on
which
steamed
tea
and
toast
though
it
was
nearly
lunch
time
place
it
on
the
table
she
said
i
shall
be
ready
soon
he
did
so
and
retired
to
the
door
when
however
he
perceived
that
she
did
not
move
he
came
back
a
few
steps
let
me
hold
it
to
you
if
you
don
t
wish
to
get
up
said
charley
he
brought
the
tray
to
the
front
of
the
couch
where
he
knelt
down
adding
i
will
hold
it
for
you
eustacia
sat
up
and
poured
out
a
cup
of
tea
you
are
very
kind
to
me
charley
she
murmured
as
she
sipped
well
i
ought
to
be
said
he
diffidently
taking
great
trouble
not
to
rest
his
eyes
upon
her
though
this
was
their
only
natural
position
eustacia
being
immediately
before
him
you
have
been
kind
to
me
how
have
i
said
eustacia
you
let
me
hold
your
hand
when
you
were
a
maiden
at
home
ah
so
i
did
why
did
i
do
that
my
mind
is
lost
it
had
to
do
with
the
mumming
had
it
not
yes
you
wanted
to
go
in
my
place
i
remember
i
do
indeed
remember
too
well
she
again
became
utterly
downcast
and
charley
seeing
that
she
was
not
going
to
eat
or
drink
any
more
took
away
the
tray
afterwards
he
occasionally
came
in
to
see
if
the
fire
was
burning
to
ask
her
if
she
wanted
anything
to
tell
her
that
the
wind
had
shifted
from
south
to
west
to
ask
her
if
she
would
like
him
to
gather
her
some
blackberries
to
all
which
inquiries
she
replied
in
the
negative
or
with
indifference
she
remained
on
the
settee
some
time
longer
when
she
aroused
herself
and
went
upstairs
the
room
in
which
she
had
formerly
slept
still
remained
much
as
she
had
left
it
and
the
recollection
that
this
forced
upon
her
of
her
own
greatly
changed
and
infinitely
worsened
situation
again
set
on
her
face
the
undetermined
and
formless
misery
which
it
had
worn
on
her
first
arrival
she
peeped
into
her
grandfather
s
room
through
which
the
fresh
autumn
air
was
blowing
from
the
open
window
her
eye
was
arrested
by
what
was
a
familiar
sight
enough
though
it
broke
upon
her
now
with
a
new
significance
it
was
a
brace
of
pistols
hanging
near
the
head
of
her
grandfather
s
bed
which
he
always
kept
there
loaded
as
a
precaution
against
possible
burglars
the
house
being
very
lonely
eustacia
regarded
them
long
as
if
they
were
the
page
of
a
book
in
which
she
read
a
new
and
a
strange
matter
quickly
like
one
afraid
of
herself
she
returned
downstairs
and
stood
in
deep
thought
if
i
could
only
do
it
she
said
it
would
be
doing
much
good
to
myself
and
all
connected
with
me
and
no
harm
to
a
single
one
the
idea
seemed
to
gather
force
within
her
and
she
remained
in
a
fixed
attitude
nearly
ten
minutes
when
a
certain
finality
was
expressed
in
her
gaze
and
no
longer
the
blankness
of
indecision
she
turned
and
went
up
the
second
time
softly
and
stealthily
now
and
entered
her
grandfather
s
room
her
eyes
at
once
seeking
the
head
of
the
bed
the
pistols
were
gone
the
instant
quashing
of
her
purpose
by
their
absence
affected
her
brain
as
a
sudden
vacuum
affects
the
body
she
nearly
fainted
who
had
done
this
there
was
only
one
person
on
the
premises
besides
herself
eustacia
involuntarily
turned
to
the
open
window
which
overlooked
the
garden
as
far
as
the
bank
that
bounded
it
on
the
summit
of
the
latter
stood
charley
sufficiently
elevated
by
its
height
to
see
into
the
room
his
gaze
was
directed
eagerly
and
solicitously
upon
her
she
went
downstairs
to
the
door
and
beckoned
to
him
you
have
taken
them
away
yes
ma
am
why
did
you
do
it
i
saw
you
looking
at
them
too
long
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
you
have
been
heart
broken
all
the
morning
as
if
you
did
not
want
to
live
well
and
i
could
not
bear
to
leave
them
in
your
way
there
was
meaning
in
your
look
at
them
where
are
they
now
locked
up
where
in
the
stable
give
them
to
me
no
ma
am
you
refuse
i
do
i
care
too
much
for
you
to
give
em
up
she
turned
aside
her
face
for
the
first
time
softening
from
the
stony
immobility
of
the
earlier
day
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
resuming
something
of
that
delicacy
of
cut
which
was
always
lost
in
her
moments
of
despair
at
last
she
confronted
him
again
why
should
i
not
die
if
i
wish
she
said
tremulously
i
have
made
a
bad
bargain
with
life
and
i
am
weary
of
it
weary
and
now
you
have
hindered
my
escape
o
why
did
you
charley
what
makes
death
painful
except
the
thought
of
others
grief
and
that
is
absent
in
my
case
for
not
a
sigh
would
follow
me
ah
it
is
trouble
that
has
done
this
i
wish
in
my
very
soul
that
he
who
brought
it
about
might
die
and
rot
even
if
tis
transportation
to
say
it
charley
no
more
of
that
what
do
you
mean
to
do
about
this
you
have
seen
keep
it
close
as
night
if
you
promise
not
to
think
of
it
again
you
need
not
fear
the
moment
has
passed
i
promise
she
then
went
away
entered
the
house
and
lay
down
later
in
the
afternoon
her
grandfather
returned
he
was
about
to
question
her
categorically
but
on
looking
at
her
he
withheld
his
words
yes
it
is
too
bad
to
talk
of
she
slowly
returned
in
answer
to
his
glance
can
my
old
room
be
got
ready
for
me
tonight
grandfather
i
shall
want
to
occupy
it
again
he
did
not
ask
what
it
all
meant
or
why
she
had
left
her
husband
but
ordered
the
room
to
be
prepared
an
old
move
inadvertently
repeated
charley
s
attentions
to
his
former
mistress
were
unbounded
the
only
solace
to
his
own
trouble
lay
in
his
attempts
to
relieve
hers
hour
after
hour
he
considered
her
wants
he
thought
of
her
presence
there
with
a
sort
of
gratitude
and
while
uttering
imprecations
on
the
cause
of
her
unhappiness
in
some
measure
blessed
the
result
perhaps
she
would
always
remain
there
he
thought
and
then
he
would
be
as
happy
as
he
had
been
before
his
dread
was
lest
she
should
think
fit
to
return
to
alderworth
and
in
that
dread
his
eyes
with
all
the
inquisitiveness
of
affection
frequently
sought
her
face
when
she
was
not
observing
him
as
he
would
have
watched
the
head
of
a
stockdove
to
learn
if
it
contemplated
flight
having
once
really
succoured
her
and
possibly
preserved
her
from
the
rashest
of
acts
he
mentally
assumed
in
addition
a
guardian
s
responsibility
for
her
welfare
for
this
reason
he
busily
endeavoured
to
provide
her
with
pleasant
distractions
bringing
home
curious
objects
which
he
found
in
the
heath
such
as
white
trumpet
shaped
mosses
redheaded
lichens
stone
arrowheads
used
by
the
old
tribes
on
egdon
and
faceted
crystals
from
the
hollows
of
flints
these
he
deposited
on
the
premises
in
such
positions
that
she
should
see
them
as
if
by
accident
a
week
passed
eustacia
never
going
out
of
the
house
then
she
walked
into
the
enclosed
plot
and
looked
through
her
grandfather
s
spyglass
as
she
had
been
in
the
habit
of
doing
before
her
marriage
one
day
she
saw
at
a
place
where
the
highroad
crossed
the
distant
valley
a
heavily
laden
wagon
passing
along
it
was
piled
with
household
furniture
she
looked
again
and
again
and
recognized
it
to
be
her
own
in
the
evening
her
grandfather
came
indoors
with
a
rumour
that
yeobright
had
removed
that
day
from
alderworth
to
the
old
house
at
blooms
end
on
another
occasion
when
reconnoitring
thus
she
beheld
two
female
figures
walking
in
the
vale
the
day
was
fine
and
clear
and
the
persons
not
being
more
than
half
a
mile
off
she
could
see
their
every
detail
with
the
telescope
the
woman
walking
in
front
carried
a
white
bundle
in
her
arms
from
one
end
of
which
hung
a
long
appendage
of
drapery
and
when
the
walkers
turned
so
that
the
sun
fell
more
directly
upon
them
eustacia
could
see
that
the
object
was
a
baby
she
called
charley
and
asked
him
if
he
knew
who
they
were
though
she
well
guessed
mrs
wildeve
and
the
nurse
girl
said
charley
the
nurse
is
carrying
the
baby
said
eustacia
no
tis
mrs
wildeve
carrying
that
he
answered
and
the
nurse
walks
behind
carrying
nothing
the
lad
was
in
good
spirits
that
day
for
the
fifth
of
november
had
again
come
round
and
he
was
planning
yet
another
scheme
to
divert
her
from
her
too
absorbing
thoughts
for
two
successive
years
his
mistress
had
seemed
to
take
pleasure
in
lighting
a
bonfire
on
the
bank
overlooking
the
valley
but
this
year
she
had
apparently
quite
forgotten
the
day
and
the
customary
deed
he
was
careful
not
to
remind
her
and
went
on
with
his
secret
preparations
for
a
cheerful
surprise
the
more
zealously
that
he
had
been
absent
last
time
and
unable
to
assist
at
every
vacant
minute
he
hastened
to
gather
furze
stumps
thorn
tree
roots
and
other
solid
materials
from
the
adjacent
slopes
hiding
them
from
cursory
view
the
evening
came
and
eustacia
was
still
seemingly
unconscious
of
the
anniversary
she
had
gone
indoors
after
her
survey
through
the
glass
and
had
not
been
visible
since
as
soon
as
it
was
quite
dark
charley
began
to
build
the
bonfire
choosing
precisely
that
spot
on
the
bank
which
eustacia
had
chosen
at
previous
times
when
all
the
surrounding
bonfires
had
burst
into
existence
charley
kindled
his
and
arranged
its
fuel
so
that
it
should
not
require
tending
for
some
time
he
then
went
back
to
the
house
and
lingered
round
the
door
and
windows
till
she
should
by
some
means
or
other
learn
of
his
achievement
and
come
out
to
witness
it
but
the
shutters
were
closed
the
door
remained
shut
and
no
heed
whatever
seemed
to
be
taken
of
his
performance
not
liking
to
call
her
he
went
back
and
replenished
the
fire
continuing
to
do
this
for
more
than
half
an
hour
it
was
not
till
his
stock
of
fuel
had
greatly
diminished
that
he
went
to
the
back
door
and
sent
in
to
beg
that
mrs
yeobright
would
open
the
window
shutters
and
see
the
sight
outside
eustacia
who
had
been
sitting
listlessly
in
the
parlour
started
up
at
the
intelligence
and
flung
open
the
shutters
facing
her
on
the
bank
blazed
the
fire
which
at
once
sent
a
ruddy
glare
into
the
room
where
she
was
and
overpowered
the
candles
well
done
charley
said
captain
vye
from
the
chimney
corner
but
i
hope
it
is
not
my
wood
that
he
s
burning
ah
it
was
this
time
last
year
that
i
met
with
that
man
venn
bringing
home
thomasin
yeobright
to
be
sure
it
was
well
who
would
have
thought
that
girl
s
troubles
would
have
ended
so
well
what
a
snipe
you
were
in
that
matter
eustacia
has
your
husband
written
to
you
yet
no
said
eustacia
looking
vaguely
through
the
window
at
the
fire
which
just
then
so
much
engaged
her
mind
that
she
did
not
resent
her
grandfather
s
blunt
opinion
she
could
see
charley
s
form
on
the
bank
shovelling
and
stirring
the
fire
and
there
flashed
upon
her
imagination
some
other
form
which
that
fire
might
call
up
she
left
the
room
put
on
her
garden
bonnet
and
cloak
and
went
out
reaching
the
bank
she
looked
over
with
a
wild
curiosity
and
misgiving
when
charley
said
to
her
with
a
pleased
sense
of
himself
i
made
it
o
purpose
for
you
ma
am
thank
you
she
said
hastily
but
i
wish
you
to
put
it
out
now
it
will
soon
burn
down
said
charley
rather
disappointed
is
it
not
a
pity
to
knock
it
out
i
don
t
know
she
musingly
answered
they
stood
in
silence
broken
only
by
the
crackling
of
the
flames
till
charley
perceiving
that
she
did
not
want
to
talk
to
him
moved
reluctantly
away
eustacia
remained
within
the
bank
looking
at
the
fire
intending
to
go
indoors
yet
lingering
still
had
she
not
by
her
situation
been
inclined
to
hold
in
indifference
all
things
honoured
of
the
gods
and
of
men
she
would
probably
have
come
away
but
her
state
was
so
hopeless
that
she
could
play
with
it
to
have
lost
is
less
disturbing
than
to
wonder
if
we
may
possibly
have
won
and
eustacia
could
now
like
other
people
at
such
a
stage
take
a
standing
point
outside
herself
observe
herself
as
a
disinterested
spectator
and
think
what
a
sport
for
heaven
this
woman
eustacia
was
while
she
stood
she
heard
a
sound
it
was
the
splash
of
a
stone
in
the
pond
had
eustacia
received
the
stone
full
in
the
bosom
her
heart
could
not
have
given
a
more
decided
thump
she
had
thought
of
the
possibility
of
such
a
signal
in
answer
to
that
which
had
been
unwittingly
given
by
charley
but
she
had
not
expected
it
yet
how
prompt
wildeve
was
yet
how
could
he
think
her
capable
of
deliberately
wishing
to
renew
their
assignations
now
an
impulse
to
leave
the
spot
a
desire
to
stay
struggled
within
her
and
the
desire
held
its
own
more
than
that
it
did
not
do
for
she
refrained
even
from
ascending
the
bank
and
looking
over
she
remained
motionless
not
disturbing
a
muscle
of
her
face
or
raising
her
eyes
for
were
she
to
turn
up
her
face
the
fire
on
the
bank
would
shine
upon
it
and
wildeve
might
be
looking
down
there
was
a
second
splash
into
the
pond
why
did
he
stay
so
long
without
advancing
and
looking
over
curiosity
had
its
way
she
ascended
one
or
two
of
the
earth
steps
in
the
bank
and
glanced
out
wildeve
was
before
her
he
had
come
forward
after
throwing
the
last
pebble
and
the
fire
now
shone
into
each
of
their
faces
from
the
bank
stretching
breast
high
between
them
i
did
not
light
it
cried
eustacia
quickly
it
was
lit
without
my
knowledge
don
t
don
t
come
over
to
me
why
have
you
been
living
here
all
these
days
without
telling
me
you
have
left
your
home
i
fear
i
am
something
to
blame
in
this
i
did
not
let
in
his
mother
that
s
how
it
is
you
do
not
deserve
what
you
have
got
eustacia
you
are
in
great
misery
i
see
it
in
your
eyes
your
mouth
and
all
over
you
my
poor
poor
girl
he
stepped
over
the
bank
you
are
beyond
everything
unhappy
no
no
not
exactly
it
has
been
pushed
too
far
it
is
killing
you
i
do
think
it
her
usually
quiet
breathing
had
grown
quicker
with
his
words
i
i
she
began
and
then
burst
into
quivering
sobs
shaken
to
the
very
heart
by
the
unexpected
voice
of
pity
a
sentiment
whose
existence
in
relation
to
herself
she
had
almost
forgotten
this
outbreak
of
weeping
took
eustacia
herself
so
much
by
surprise
that
she
could
not
leave
off
and
she
turned
aside
from
him
in
some
shame
though
turning
hid
nothing
from
him
she
sobbed
on
desperately
then
the
outpour
lessened
and
she
became
quieter
wildeve
had
resisted
the
impulse
to
clasp
her
and
stood
without
speaking
are
you
not
ashamed
of
me
who
used
never
to
be
a
crying
animal
she
asked
in
a
weak
whisper
as
she
wiped
her
eyes
why
didn
t
you
go
away
i
wish
you
had
not
seen
quite
all
that
it
reveals
too
much
by
half
you
might
have
wished
it
because
it
makes
me
as
sad
as
you
he
said
with
emotion
and
deference
as
for
revealing
the
word
is
impossible
between
us
two
i
did
not
send
for
you
don
t
forget
it
damon
i
am
in
pain
but
i
did
not
send
for
you
as
a
wife
at
least
i
ve
been
straight
never
mind
i
came
o
eustacia
forgive
me
for
the
harm
i
have
done
you
in
these
two
past
years
i
see
more
and
more
that
i
have
been
your
ruin
not
you
this
place
i
live
in
ah
your
generosity
may
naturally
make
you
say
that
but
i
am
the
culprit
i
should
either
have
done
more
or
nothing
at
all
in
what
way
i
ought
never
to
have
hunted
you
out
or
having
done
it
i
ought
to
have
persisted
in
retaining
you
but
of
course
i
have
no
right
to
talk
of
that
now
i
will
only
ask
this
can
i
do
anything
for
you
is
there
anything
on
the
face
of
the
earth
that
a
man
can
do
to
make
you
happier
than
you
are
at
present
if
there
is
i
will
do
it
you
may
command
me
eustacia
to
the
limit
of
my
influence
and
don
t
forget
that
i
am
richer
now
surely
something
can
be
done
to
save
you
from
this
such
a
rare
plant
in
such
a
wild
place
it
grieves
me
to
see
do
you
want
anything
bought
do
you
want
to
go
anywhere
do
you
want
to
escape
the
place
altogether
only
say
it
and
i
ll
do
anything
to
put
an
end
to
those
tears
which
but
for
me
would
never
have
been
at
all
we
are
each
married
to
another
person
she
said
faintly
and
assistance
from
you
would
have
an
evil
sound
after
after
well
there
s
no
preventing
slanderers
from
having
their
fill
at
any
time
but
you
need
not
be
afraid
whatever
i
may
feel
i
promise
you
on
my
word
of
honour
never
to
speak
to
you
about
or
act
upon
until
you
say
i
may
i
know
my
duty
to
thomasin
quite
as
well
as
i
know
my
duty
to
you
as
a
woman
unfairly
treated
what
shall
i
assist
you
in
in
getting
away
from
here
where
do
you
wish
to
go
to
i
have
a
place
in
my
mind
if
you
could
help
me
as
far
as
budmouth
i
can
do
all
the
rest
steamers
sail
from
there
across
the
channel
and
so
i
can
get
to
paris
where
i
want
to
be
yes
she
pleaded
earnestly
help
me
to
get
to
budmouth
harbour
without
my
grandfather
s
or
my
husband
s
knowledge
and
i
can
do
all
the
rest
will
it
be
safe
to
leave
you
there
alone
yes
yes
i
know
budmouth
well
shall
i
go
with
you
i
am
rich
now
she
was
silent
say
yes
sweet
she
was
silent
still
well
let
me
know
when
you
wish
to
go
we
shall
be
at
our
present
house
till
december
after
that
we
remove
to
casterbridge
command
me
in
anything
till
that
time
i
will
think
of
this
she
said
hurriedly
whether
i
can
honestly
make
use
of
you
as
a
friend
or
must
close
with
you
as
a
lover
that
is
what
i
must
ask
myself
if
i
wish
to
go
and
decide
to
accept
your
company
i
will
signal
to
you
some
evening
at
eight
o
clock
punctually
and
this
will
mean
that
you
are
to
be
ready
with
a
horse
and
trap
at
twelve
o
clock
the
same
night
to
drive
me
to
budmouth
harbour
in
time
for
the
morning
boat
i
will
look
out
every
night
at
eight
and
no
signal
shall
escape
me
now
please
go
away
if
i
decide
on
this
escape
i
can
only
meet
you
once
more
unless
i
cannot
go
without
you
go
i
cannot
bear
it
longer
go
go
wildeve
slowly
went
up
the
steps
and
descended
into
the
darkness
on
the
other
side
and
as
he
walked
he
glanced
back
till
the
bank
blotted
out
her
form
from
his
further
view
thomasin
argues
with
her
cousin
and
he
writes
a
letter
yeobright
was
at
this
time
at
blooms
end
hoping
that
eustacia
would
return
to
him
the
removal
of
furniture
had
been
accomplished
only
that
day
though
clym
had
lived
in
the
old
house
for
more
than
a
week
he
had
spent
the
time
in
working
about
the
premises
sweeping
leaves
from
the
garden
paths
cutting
dead
stalks
from
the
flower
beds
and
nailing
up
creepers
which
had
been
displaced
by
the
autumn
winds
he
took
no
particular
pleasure
in
these
deeds
but
they
formed
a
screen
between
himself
and
despair
moreover
it
had
become
a
religion
with
him
to
preserve
in
good
condition
all
that
had
lapsed
from
his
mother
s
hands
to
his
own
during
these
operations
he
was
constantly
on
the
watch
for
eustacia
that
there
should
be
no
mistake
about
her
knowing
where
to
find
him
he
had
ordered
a
notice
board
to
be
affixed
to
the
garden
gate
at
alderworth
signifying
in
white
letters
whither
he
had
removed
when
a
leaf
floated
to
the
earth
he
turned
his
head
thinking
it
might
be
her
foot
fall
a
bird
searching
for
worms
in
the
mould
of
the
flower
beds
sounded
like
her
hand
on
the
latch
of
the
gate
and
at
dusk
when
soft
strange
ventriloquisms
came
from
holes
in
the
ground
hollow
stalks
curled
dead
leaves
and
other
crannies
wherein
breezes
worms
and
insects
can
work
their
will
he
fancied
that
they
were
eustacia
standing
without
and
breathing
wishes
of
reconciliation
up
to
this
hour
he
had
persevered
in
his
resolve
not
to
invite
her
back
at
the
same
time
the
severity
with
which
he
had
treated
her
lulled
the
sharpness
of
his
regret
for
his
mother
and
awoke
some
of
his
old
solicitude
for
his
mother
s
supplanter
harsh
feelings
produce
harsh
usage
and
this
by
reaction
quenches
the
sentiments
that
gave
it
birth
the
more
he
reflected
the
more
he
softened
but
to
look
upon
his
wife
as
innocence
in
distress
was
impossible
though
he
could
ask
himself
whether
he
had
given
her
quite
time
enough
if
he
had
not
come
a
little
too
suddenly
upon
her
on
that
sombre
morning
now
that
the
first
flush
of
his
anger
had
paled
he
was
disinclined
to
ascribe
to
her
more
than
an
indiscreet
friendship
with
wildeve
for
there
had
not
appeared
in
her
manner
the
signs
of
dishonour
and
this
once
admitted
an
absolutely
dark
interpretation
of
her
act
towards
his
mother
was
no
longer
forced
upon
him
on
the
evening
of
the
fifth
november
his
thoughts
of
eustacia
were
intense
echoes
from
those
past
times
when
they
had
exchanged
tender
words
all
the
day
long
came
like
the
diffused
murmur
of
a
seashore
left
miles
behind
surely
he
said
she
might
have
brought
herself
to
communicate
with
me
before
now
and
confess
honestly
what
wildeve
was
to
her
instead
of
remaining
at
home
that
night
he
determined
to
go
and
see
thomasin
and
her
husband
if
he
found
opportunity
he
would
allude
to
the
cause
of
the
separation
between
eustacia
and
himself
keeping
silence
however
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
third
person
in
his
house
when
his
mother
was
turned
away
if
it
proved
that
wildeve
was
innocently
there
he
would
doubtless
openly
mention
it
if
he
were
there
with
unjust
intentions
wildeve
being
a
man
of
quick
feeling
might
possibly
say
something
to
reveal
the
extent
to
which
eustacia
was
compromised
but
on
reaching
his
cousin
s
house
he
found
that
only
thomasin
was
at
home
wildeve
being
at
that
time
on
his
way
towards
the
bonfire
innocently
lit
by
charley
at
mistover
thomasin
then
as
always
was
glad
to
see
clym
and
took
him
to
inspect
the
sleeping
baby
carefully
screening
the
candlelight
from
the
infant
s
eyes
with
her
hand
tamsin
have
you
heard
that
eustacia
is
not
with
me
now
he
said
when
they
had
sat
down
again
no
said
thomasin
alarmed
and
not
that
i
have
left
alderworth
no
i
never
hear
tidings
from
alderworth
unless
you
bring
them
what
is
the
matter
clym
in
a
disturbed
voice
related
to
her
his
visit
to
susan
nunsuch
s
boy
the
revelation
he
had
made
and
what
had
resulted
from
his
charging
eustacia
with
having
wilfully
and
heartlessly
done
the
deed
he
suppressed
all
mention
of
wildeve
s
presence
with
her
all
this
and
i
not
knowing
it
murmured
thomasin
in
an
awestruck
tone
terrible
what
could
have
made
her
o
eustacia
and
when
you
found
it
out
you
went
in
hot
haste
to
her
were
you
too
cruel
or
is
she
really
so
wicked
as
she
seems
can
a
man
be
too
cruel
to
his
mother
s
enemy
i
can
fancy
so
very
well
then
i
ll
admit
that
he
can
but
now
what
is
to
be
done
make
it
up
again
if
a
quarrel
so
deadly
can
ever
be
made
up
i
almost
wish
you
had
not
told
me
but
do
try
to
be
reconciled
there
are
ways
after
all
if
you
both
wish
to
i
don
t
know
that
we
do
both
wish
to
make
it
up
said
clym
if
she
had
wished
it
would
she
not
have
sent
to
me
by
this
time
you
seem
to
wish
to
and
yet
you
have
not
sent
to
her
true
but
i
have
been
tossed
to
and
fro
in
doubt
if
i
ought
after
such
strong
provocation
to
see
me
now
thomasin
gives
you
no
idea
of
what
i
have
been
of
what
depths
i
have
descended
to
in
these
few
last
days
o
it
was
a
bitter
shame
to
shut
out
my
mother
like
that
can
i
ever
forget
it
or
even
agree
to
see
her
again
she
might
not
have
known
that
anything
serious
would
come
of
it
and
perhaps
she
did
not
mean
to
keep
aunt
out
altogether
she
says
herself
that
she
did
not
but
the
fact
remains
that
keep
her
out
she
did
believe
her
sorry
and
send
for
her
how
if
she
will
not
come
it
will
prove
her
guilty
by
showing
that
it
is
her
habit
to
nourish
enmity
but
i
do
not
think
that
for
a
moment
i
will
do
this
i
will
wait
for
a
day
or
two
longer
not
longer
than
two
days
certainly
and
if
she
does
not
send
to
me
in
that
time
i
will
indeed
send
to
her
i
thought
to
have
seen
wildeve
here
tonight
is
he
from
home
thomasin
blushed
a
little
no
she
said
he
is
merely
gone
out
for
a
walk
why
didn
t
he
take
you
with
him
the
evening
is
fine
you
want
fresh
air
as
well
as
he
oh
i
don
t
care
for
going
anywhere
besides
there
is
baby
yes
yes
well
i
have
been
thinking
whether
i
should
not
consult
your
husband
about
this
as
well
as
you
said
clym
steadily
i
fancy
i
would
not
she
quickly
answered
it
can
do
no
good
her
cousin
looked
her
in
the
face
no
doubt
thomasin
was
ignorant
that
her
husband
had
any
share
in
the
events
of
that
tragic
afternoon
but
her
countenance
seemed
to
signify
that
she
concealed
some
suspicion
or
thought
of
the
reputed
tender
relations
between
wildeve
and
eustacia
in
days
gone
by
clym
however
could
make
nothing
of
it
and
he
rose
to
depart
more
in
doubt
than
when
he
came
you
will
write
to
her
in
a
day
or
two
said
the
young
woman
earnestly
i
do
so
hope
the
wretched
separation
may
come
to
an
end
i
will
said
clym
i
don
t
rejoice
in
my
present
state
at
all
and
he
left
her
and
climbed
over
the
hill
to
blooms
end
before
going
to
bed
he
sat
down
and
wrote
the
following
letter
my
dear
eustacia
i
must
obey
my
heart
without
consulting
my
reason
too
closely
will
you
come
back
to
me
do
so
and
the
past
shall
never
be
mentioned
i
was
too
severe
but
o
eustacia
the
provocation
you
don
t
know
you
never
will
know
what
those
words
of
anger
cost
me
which
you
drew
down
upon
yourself
all
that
an
honest
man
can
promise
you
i
promise
now
which
is
that
from
me
you
shall
never
suffer
anything
on
this
score
again
after
all
the
vows
we
have
made
eustacia
i
think
we
had
better
pass
the
remainder
of
our
lives
in
trying
to
keep
them
come
to
me
then
even
if
you
reproach
me
i
have
thought
of
your
sufferings
that
morning
on
which
i
parted
from
you
i
know
they
were
genuine
and
they
are
as
much
as
you
ought
to
bear
our
love
must
still
continue
such
hearts
as
ours
would
never
have
been
given
us
but
to
be
concerned
with
each
other
i
could
not
ask
you
back
at
first
eustacia
for
i
was
unable
to
persuade
myself
that
he
who
was
with
you
was
not
there
as
a
lover
but
if
you
will
come
and
explain
distracting
appearances
i
do
not
question
that
you
can
show
your
honesty
to
me
why
have
you
not
come
before
do
you
think
i
will
not
listen
to
you
surely
not
when
you
remember
the
kisses
and
vows
we
exchanged
under
the
summer
moon
return
then
and
you
shall
be
warmly
welcomed
i
can
no
longer
think
of
you
to
your
prejudice
i
am
but
too
much
absorbed
in
justifying
you
your
husband
as
ever
clym
there
he
said
as
he
laid
it
in
his
desk
that
s
a
good
thing
done
if
she
does
not
come
before
tomorrow
night
i
will
send
it
to
her
meanwhile
at
the
house
he
had
just
left
thomasin
sat
sighing
uneasily
fidelity
to
her
husband
had
that
evening
induced
her
to
conceal
all
suspicion
that
wildeve
s
interest
in
eustacia
had
not
ended
with
his
marriage
but
she
knew
nothing
positive
and
though
clym
was
her
well
beloved
cousin
there
was
one
nearer
to
her
still
when
a
little
later
wildeve
returned
from
his
walk
to
mistover
thomasin
said
damon
where
have
you
been
i
was
getting
quite
frightened
and
thought
you
had
fallen
into
the
river
i
dislike
being
in
the
house
by
myself
frightened
he
said
touching
her
cheek
as
if
she
were
some
domestic
animal
why
i
thought
nothing
could
frighten
you
it
is
that
you
are
getting
proud
i
am
sure
and
don
t
like
living
here
since
we
have
risen
above
our
business
well
it
is
a
tedious
matter
this
getting
a
new
house
but
i
couldn
t
have
set
about
it
sooner
unless
our
ten
thousand
pounds
had
been
a
hundred
thousand
when
we
could
have
afforded
to
despise
caution
no
i
don
t
mind
waiting
i
would
rather
stay
here
twelve
months
longer
than
run
any
risk
with
baby
but
i
don
t
like
your
vanishing
so
in
the
evenings
there
s
something
on
your
mind
i
know
there
is
damon
you
go
about
so
gloomily
and
look
at
the
heath
as
if
it
were
somebody
s
gaol
instead
of
a
nice
wild
place
to
walk
in
he
looked
towards
her
with
pitying
surprise
what
do
you
like
egdon
heath
he
said
i
like
what
i
was
born
near
to
i
admire
its
grim
old
face
pooh
my
dear
you
don
t
know
what
you
like
i
am
sure
i
do
there
s
only
one
thing
unpleasant
about
egdon
what
s
that
you
never
take
me
with
you
when
you
walk
there
why
do
you
wander
so
much
in
it
yourself
if
you
so
dislike
it
the
inquiry
though
a
simple
one
was
plainly
disconcerting
and
he
sat
down
before
replying
i
don
t
think
you
often
see
me
there
give
an
instance
i
will
she
answered
triumphantly
when
you
went
out
this
evening
i
thought
that
as
baby
was
asleep
i
would
see
where
you
were
going
to
so
mysteriously
without
telling
me
so
i
ran
out
and
followed
behind
you
you
stopped
at
the
place
where
the
road
forks
looked
round
at
the
bonfires
and
then
said
damn
it
i
ll
go
and
you
went
quickly
up
the
left
hand
road
then
i
stood
and
watched
you
wildeve
frowned
afterwards
saying
with
a
forced
smile
well
what
wonderful
discovery
did
you
make
there
now
you
are
angry
and
we
won
t
talk
of
this
any
more
she
went
across
to
him
sat
on
a
footstool
and
looked
up
in
his
face
nonsense
he
said
that
s
how
you
always
back
out
we
will
go
on
with
it
now
we
have
begun
what
did
you
next
see
i
particularly
want
to
know
don
t
be
like
that
damon
she
murmured
i
didn
t
see
anything
you
vanished
out
of
sight
and
then
i
looked
round
at
the
bonfires
and
came
in
perhaps
this
is
not
the
only
time
you
have
dogged
my
steps
are
you
trying
to
find
out
something
bad
about
me
not
at
all
i
have
never
done
such
a
thing
before
and
i
shouldn
t
have
done
it
now
if
words
had
not
sometimes
been
dropped
about
you
what
do
you
mean
he
impatiently
asked
they
say
they
say
you
used
to
go
to
alderworth
in
the
evenings
and
it
puts
into
my
mind
what
i
have
heard
about
wildeve
turned
angrily
and
stood
up
in
front
of
her
now
he
said
flourishing
his
hand
in
the
air
just
out
with
it
madam
i
demand
to
know
what
remarks
you
have
heard
well
i
heard
that
you
used
to
be
very
fond
of
eustacia
nothing
more
than
that
though
dropped
in
a
bit
by
bit
way
you
ought
not
to
be
angry
he
observed
that
her
eyes
were
brimming
with
tears
well
he
said
there
is
nothing
new
in
that
and
of
course
i
don
t
mean
to
be
rough
towards
you
so
you
need
not
cry
now
don
t
let
us
speak
of
the
subject
any
more
and
no
more
was
said
thomasin
being
glad
enough
of
a
reason
for
not
mentioning
clym
s
visit
to
her
that
evening
and
his
story
the
night
of
the
sixth
of
november
having
resolved
on
flight
eustacia
at
times
seemed
anxious
that
something
should
happen
to
thwart
her
own
intention
the
only
event
that
could
really
change
her
position
was
the
appearance
of
clym
the
glory
which
had
encircled
him
as
her
lover
was
departed
now
yet
some
good
simple
quality
of
his
would
occasionally
return
to
her
memory
and
stir
a
momentary
throb
of
hope
that
he
would
again
present
himself
before
her
but
calmly
considered
it
was
not
likely
that
such
a
severance
as
now
existed
would
ever
close
up
she
would
have
to
live
on
as
a
painful
object
isolated
and
out
of
place
she
had
used
to
think
of
the
heath
alone
as
an
uncongenial
spot
to
be
in
she
felt
it
now
of
the
whole
world
towards
evening
on
the
sixth
her
determination
to
go
away
again
revived
about
four
o
clock
she
packed
up
anew
the
few
small
articles
she
had
brought
in
her
flight
from
alderworth
and
also
some
belonging
to
her
which
had
been
left
here
the
whole
formed
a
bundle
not
too
large
to
be
carried
in
her
hand
for
a
distance
of
a
mile
or
two
the
scene
without
grew
darker
mud
coloured
clouds
bellied
downwards
from
the
sky
like
vast
hammocks
slung
across
it
and
with
the
increase
of
night
a
stormy
wind
arose
but
as
yet
there
was
no
rain
eustacia
could
not
rest
indoors
having
nothing
more
to
do
and
she
wandered
to
and
fro
on
the
hill
not
far
from
the
house
she
was
soon
to
leave
in
these
desultory
ramblings
she
passed
the
cottage
of
susan
nunsuch
a
little
lower
down
than
her
grandfather
s
the
door
was
ajar
and
a
riband
of
bright
firelight
fell
over
the
ground
without
as
eustacia
crossed
the
firebeams
she
appeared
for
an
instant
as
distinct
as
a
figure
in
a
phantasmagoria
a
creature
of
light
surrounded
by
an
area
of
darkness
the
moment
passed
and
she
was
absorbed
in
night
again
a
woman
who
was
sitting
inside
the
cottage
had
seen
and
recognized
her
in
that
momentary
irradiation
this
was
susan
herself
occupied
in
preparing
a
posset
for
her
little
boy
who
often
ailing
was
now
seriously
unwell
susan
dropped
the
spoon
shook
her
fist
at
the
vanished
figure
and
then
proceeded
with
her
work
in
a
musing
absent
way
at
eight
o
clock
the
hour
at
which
eustacia
had
promised
to
signal
wildeve
if
ever
she
signalled
at
all
she
looked
around
the
premises
to
learn
if
the
coast
was
clear
went
to
the
furze
rick
and
pulled
thence
a
long
stemmed
bough
of
that
fuel
this
she
carried
to
the
corner
of
the
bank
and
glancing
behind
to
see
if
the
shutters
were
all
closed
she
struck
a
light
and
kindled
the
furze
when
it
was
thoroughly
ablaze
eustacia
took
it
by
the
stem
and
waved
it
in
the
air
above
her
head
till
it
had
burned
itself
out
she
was
gratified
if
gratification
were
possible
to
such
a
mood
by
seeing
a
similar
light
in
the
vicinity
of
wildeve
s
residence
a
minute
or
two
later
having
agreed
to
keep
watch
at
this
hour
every
night
in
case
she
should
require
assistance
this
promptness
proved
how
strictly
he
had
held
to
his
word
four
hours
after
the
present
time
that
is
at
midnight
he
was
to
be
ready
to
drive
her
to
budmouth
as
prearranged
eustacia
returned
to
the
house
supper
having
been
got
over
she
retired
early
and
sat
in
her
bedroom
waiting
for
the
time
to
go
by
the
night
being
dark
and
threatening
captain
vye
had
not
strolled
out
to
gossip
in
any
cottage
or
to
call
at
the
inn
as
was
sometimes
his
custom
on
these
long
autumn
nights
and
he
sat
sipping
grog
alone
downstairs
about
ten
o
clock
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
when
the
servant
opened
it
the
rays
of
the
candle
fell
upon
the
form
of
fairway
i
was
a
forced
to
go
to
lower
mistover
tonight
he
said
and
mr
yeobright
asked
me
to
leave
this
here
on
my
way
but
faith
i
put
it
in
the
lining
of
my
hat
and
thought
no
more
about
it
till
i
got
back
and
was
hasping
my
gate
before
going
to
bed
so
i
have
run
back
with
it
at
once
he
handed
in
a
letter
and
went
his
way
the
girl
brought
it
to
the
captain
who
found
that
it
was
directed
to
eustacia
he
turned
it
over
and
over
and
fancied
that
the
writing
was
her
husband
s
though
he
could
not
be
sure
however
he
decided
to
let
her
have
it
at
once
if
possible
and
took
it
upstairs
for
that
purpose
but
on
reaching
the
door
of
her
room
and
looking
in
at
the
keyhole
he
found
there
was
no
light
within
the
fact
being
that
eustacia
without
undressing
had
flung
herself
upon
the
bed
to
rest
and
gather
a
little
strength
for
her
coming
journey
her
grandfather
concluded
from
what
he
saw
that
he
ought
not
to
disturb
her
and
descending
again
to
the
parlour
he
placed
the
letter
on
the
mantelpiece
to
give
it
to
her
in
the
morning
at
eleven
o
clock
he
went
to
bed
himself
smoked
for
some
time
in
his
bedroom
put
out
his
light
at
half
past
eleven
and
then
as
was
his
invariable
custom
pulled
up
the
blind
before
getting
into
bed
that
he
might
see
which
way
the
wind
blew
on
opening
his
eyes
in
the
morning
his
bedroom
window
commanding
a
view
of
the
flagstaff
and
vane
just
as
he
had
lain
down
he
was
surprised
to
observe
the
white
pole
of
the
staff
flash
into
existence
like
a
streak
of
phosphorus
drawn
downwards
across
the
shade
of
night
without
only
one
explanation
met
this
a
light
had
been
suddenly
thrown
upon
the
pole
from
the
direction
of
the
house
as
everybody
had
retired
to
rest
the
old
man
felt
it
necessary
to
get
out
of
bed
open
the
window
softly
and
look
to
the
right
and
left
eustacia
s
bedroom
was
lighted
up
and
it
was
the
shine
from
her
window
which
had
lighted
the
pole
wondering
what
had
aroused
her
he
remained
undecided
at
the
window
and
was
thinking
of
fetching
the
letter
to
slip
it
under
her
door
when
he
heard
a
slight
brushing
of
garments
on
the
partition
dividing
his
room
from
the
passage
the
captain
concluded
that
eustacia
feeling
wakeful
had
gone
for
a
book
and
would
have
dismissed
the
matter
as
unimportant
if
he
had
not
also
heard
her
distinctly
weeping
as
she
passed
she
is
thinking
of
that
husband
of
hers
he
said
to
himself
ah
the
silly
goose
she
had
no
business
to
marry
him
i
wonder
if
that
letter
is
really
his
he
arose
threw
his
boat
cloak
round
him
opened
the
door
and
said
eustacia
there
was
no
answer
eustacia
he
repeated
louder
there
is
a
letter
on
the
mantelpiece
for
you
but
no
response
was
made
to
this
statement
save
an
imaginary
one
from
the
wind
which
seemed
to
gnaw
at
the
corners
of
the
house
and
the
stroke
of
a
few
drops
of
rain
upon
the
windows
he
went
on
to
the
landing
and
stood
waiting
nearly
five
minutes
still
she
did
not
return
he
went
back
for
a
light
and
prepared
to
follow
her
but
first
he
looked
into
her
bedroom
there
on
the
outside
of
the
quilt
was
the
impression
of
her
form
showing
that
the
bed
had
not
been
opened
and
what
was
more
significant
she
had
not
taken
her
candlestick
downstairs
he
was
now
thoroughly
alarmed
and
hastily
putting
on
his
clothes
he
descended
to
the
front
door
which
he
himself
had
bolted
and
locked
it
was
now
unfastened
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
that
eustacia
had
left
the
house
at
this
midnight
hour
and
whither
could
she
have
gone
to
follow
her
was
almost
impossible
had
the
dwelling
stood
in
an
ordinary
road
two
persons
setting
out
one
in
each
direction
might
have
made
sure
of
overtaking
her
but
it
was
a
hopeless
task
to
seek
for
anybody
on
a
heath
in
the
dark
the
practicable
directions
for
flight
across
it
from
any
point
being
as
numerous
as
the
meridians
radiating
from
the
pole
perplexed
what
to
do
he
looked
into
the
parlour
and
was
vexed
to
find
that
the
letter
still
lay
there
untouched
at
half
past
eleven
finding
that
the
house
was
silent
eustacia
had
lighted
her
candle
put
on
some
warm
outer
wrappings
taken
her
bag
in
her
hand
and
extinguishing
the
light
again
descended
the
staircase
when
she
got
into
the
outer
air
she
found
that
it
had
begun
to
rain
and
as
she
stood
pausing
at
the
door
it
increased
threatening
to
come
on
heavily
but
having
committed
herself
to
this
line
of
action
there
was
no
retreating
for
bad
weather
even
the
receipt
of
clym
s
letter
would
not
have
stopped
her
now
the
gloom
of
the
night
was
funereal
all
nature
seemed
clothed
in
crape
the
spiky
points
of
the
fir
trees
behind
the
house
rose
into
the
sky
like
the
turrets
and
pinnacles
of
an
abbey
nothing
below
the
horizon
was
visible
save
a
light
which
was
still
burning
in
the
cottage
of
susan
nunsuch
eustacia
opened
her
umbrella
and
went
out
from
the
enclosure
by
the
steps
over
the
bank
after
which
she
was
beyond
all
danger
of
being
perceived
skirting
the
pool
she
followed
the
path
towards
rainbarrow
occasionally
stumbling
over
twisted
furze
roots
tufts
of
rushes
or
oozing
lumps
of
fleshy
fungi
which
at
this
season
lay
scattered
about
the
heath
like
the
rotten
liver
and
lungs
of
some
colossal
animal
the
moon
and
stars
were
closed
up
by
cloud
and
rain
to
the
degree
of
extinction
it
was
a
night
which
led
the
traveller
s
thoughts
instinctively
to
dwell
on
nocturnal
scenes
of
disaster
in
the
chronicles
of
the
world
on
all
that
is
terrible
and
dark
in
history
and
legend
the
last
plague
of
egypt
the
destruction
of
sennacherib
s
host
the
agony
in
gethsemane
eustacia
at
length
reached
rainbarrow
and
stood
still
there
to
think
never
was
harmony
more
perfect
than
that
between
the
chaos
of
her
mind
and
the
chaos
of
the
world
without
a
sudden
recollection
had
flashed
on
her
this
moment
she
had
not
money
enough
for
undertaking
a
long
journey
amid
the
fluctuating
sentiments
of
the
day
her
unpractical
mind
had
not
dwelt
on
the
necessity
of
being
well
provided
and
now
that
she
thoroughly
realized
the
conditions
she
sighed
bitterly
and
ceased
to
stand
erect
gradually
crouching
down
under
the
umbrella
as
if
she
were
drawn
into
the
barrow
by
a
hand
from
beneath
could
it
be
that
she
was
to
remain
a
captive
still
money
she
had
never
felt
its
value
before
even
to
efface
herself
from
the
country
means
were
required
to
ask
wildeve
for
pecuniary
aid
without
allowing
him
to
accompany
her
was
impossible
to
a
woman
with
a
shadow
of
pride
left
in
her
to
fly
as
his
mistress
and
she
knew
that
he
loved
her
was
of
the
nature
of
humiliation
anyone
who
had
stood
by
now
would
have
pitied
her
not
so
much
on
account
of
her
exposure
to
weather
and
isolation
from
all
of
humanity
except
the
mouldered
remains
inside
the
tumulus
but
for
that
other
form
of
misery
which
was
denoted
by
the
slightly
rocking
movement
that
her
feelings
imparted
to
her
person
extreme
unhappiness
weighed
visibly
upon
her
between
the
drippings
of
the
rain
from
her
umbrella
to
her
mantle
from
her
mantle
to
the
heather
from
the
heather
to
the
earth
very
similar
sounds
could
be
heard
coming
from
her
lips
and
the
tearfulness
of
the
outer
scene
was
repeated
upon
her
face
the
wings
of
her
soul
were
broken
by
the
cruel
obstructiveness
of
all
about
her
and
even
had
she
seen
herself
in
a
promising
way
of
getting
to
budmouth
entering
a
steamer
and
sailing
to
some
opposite
port
she
would
have
been
but
little
more
buoyant
so
fearfully
malignant
were
other
things
she
uttered
words
aloud
when
a
woman
in
such
a
situation
neither
old
deaf
crazed
nor
whimsical
takes
upon
herself
to
sob
and
soliloquize
aloud
there
is
something
grievous
the
matter
can
i
go
can
i
go
she
moaned
he
s
not
great
enough
for
me
to
give
myself
to
he
does
not
suffice
for
my
desire
if
he
had
been
a
saul
or
a
bonaparte
ah
but
to
break
my
marriage
vow
for
him
it
is
too
poor
a
luxury
and
i
have
no
money
to
go
alone
and
if
i
could
what
comfort
to
me
i
must
drag
on
next
year
as
i
have
dragged
on
this
year
and
the
year
after
that
as
before
how
i
have
tried
and
tried
to
be
a
splendid
woman
and
how
destiny
has
been
against
me
i
do
not
deserve
my
lot
she
cried
in
a
frenzy
of
bitter
revolt
o
the
cruelty
of
putting
me
into
this
ill
conceived
world
i
was
capable
of
much
but
i
have
been
injured
and
blighted
and
crushed
by
things
beyond
my
control
o
how
hard
it
is
of
heaven
to
devise
such
tortures
for
me
who
have
done
no
harm
to
heaven
at
all
the
distant
light
which
eustacia
had
cursorily
observed
in
leaving
the
house
came
as
she
had
divined
from
the
cottage
window
of
susan
nunsuch
what
eustacia
did
not
divine
was
the
occupation
of
the
woman
within
at
that
moment
susan
s
sight
of
her
passing
figure
earlier
in
the
evening
not
five
minutes
after
the
sick
boy
s
exclamation
mother
i
do
feel
so
bad
persuaded
the
matron
that
an
evil
influence
was
certainly
exercised
by
eustacia
s
propinquity
on
this
account
susan
did
not
go
to
bed
as
soon
as
the
evening
s
work
was
over
as
she
would
have
done
at
ordinary
times
to
counteract
the
malign
spell
which
she
imagined
poor
eustacia
to
be
working
the
boy
s
mother
busied
herself
with
a
ghastly
invention
of
superstition
calculated
to
bring
powerlessness
atrophy
and
annihilation
on
any
human
being
against
whom
it
was
directed
it
was
a
practice
well
known
on
egdon
at
that
date
and
one
that
is
not
quite
extinct
at
the
present
day
she
passed
with
her
candle
into
an
inner
room
where
among
other
utensils
were
two
large
brown
pans
containing
together
perhaps
a
hundredweight
of
liquid
honey
the
produce
of
the
bees
during
the
foregoing
summer
on
a
shelf
over
the
pans
was
a
smooth
and
solid
yellow
mass
of
a
hemispherical
form
consisting
of
beeswax
from
the
same
take
of
honey
susan
took
down
the
lump
and
cutting
off
several
thin
slices
heaped
them
in
an
iron
ladle
with
which
she
returned
to
the
living
room
and
placed
the
vessel
in
the
hot
ashes
of
the
fireplace
as
soon
as
the
wax
had
softened
to
the
plasticity
of
dough
she
kneaded
the
pieces
together
and
now
her
face
became
more
intent
she
began
moulding
the
wax
and
it
was
evident
from
her
manner
of
manipulation
that
she
was
endeavouring
to
give
it
some
preconceived
form
the
form
was
human
by
warming
and
kneading
cutting
and
twisting
dismembering
and
re
joining
the
incipient
image
she
had
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
produced
a
shape
which
tolerably
well
resembled
a
woman
and
was
about
six
inches
high
she
laid
it
on
the
table
to
get
cold
and
hard
meanwhile
she
took
the
candle
and
went
upstairs
to
where
the
little
boy
was
lying
did
you
notice
my
dear
what
mrs
eustacia
wore
this
afternoon
besides
the
dark
dress
a
red
ribbon
round
her
neck
anything
else
no
except
sandal
shoes
a
red
ribbon
and
sandal
shoes
she
said
to
herself
mrs
nunsuch
went
and
searched
till
she
found
a
fragment
of
the
narrowest
red
ribbon
which
she
took
downstairs
and
tied
round
the
neck
of
the
image
then
fetching
ink
and
a
quilt
from
the
rickety
bureau
by
the
window
she
blackened
the
feet
of
the
image
to
the
extent
presumably
covered
by
shoes
and
on
the
instep
of
each
foot
marked
cross
lines
in
the
shape
taken
by
the
sandalstrings
of
those
days
finally
she
tied
a
bit
of
black
thread
round
the
upper
part
of
the
head
in
faint
resemblance
to
a
snood
worn
for
confining
the
hair
susan
held
the
object
at
arm
s
length
and
contemplated
it
with
a
satisfaction
in
which
there
was
no
smile
to
anybody
acquainted
with
the
inhabitants
of
egdon
heath
the
image
would
have
suggested
eustacia
yeobright
from
her
workbasket
in
the
window
seat
the
woman
took
a
paper
of
pins
of
the
old
long
and
yellow
sort
whose
heads
were
disposed
to
come
off
at
their
first
usage
these
she
began
to
thrust
into
the
image
in
all
directions
with
apparently
excruciating
energy
probably
as
many
as
fifty
were
thus
inserted
some
into
the
head
of
the
wax
model
some
into
the
shoulders
some
into
the
trunk
some
upwards
through
the
soles
of
the
feet
till
the
figure
was
completely
permeated
with
pins
she
turned
to
the
fire
it
had
been
of
turf
and
though
the
high
heap
of
ashes
which
turf
fires
produce
was
somewhat
dark
and
dead
on
the
outside
upon
raking
it
abroad
with
the
shovel
the
inside
of
the
mass
showed
a
glow
of
red
heat
she
took
a
few
pieces
of
fresh
turf
from
the
chimney
corner
and
built
them
together
over
the
glow
upon
which
the
fire
brightened
seizing
with
the
tongs
the
image
that
she
had
made
of
eustacia
she
held
it
in
the
heat
and
watched
it
as
it
began
to
waste
slowly
away
and
while
she
stood
thus
engaged
there
came
from
between
her
lips
a
murmur
of
words
it
was
a
strange
jargon
the
lord
s
prayer
repeated
backwards
the
incantation
usual
in
proceedings
for
obtaining
unhallowed
assistance
against
an
enemy
susan
uttered
the
lugubrious
discourse
three
times
slowly
and
when
it
was
completed
the
image
had
considerably
diminished
as
the
wax
dropped
into
the
fire
a
long
flame
arose
from
the
spot
and
curling
its
tongue
round
the
figure
ate
still
further
into
its
substance
a
pin
occasionally
dropped
with
the
wax
and
the
embers
heated
it
red
as
it
lay
rain
darkness
and
anxious
wanderers
while
the
effigy
of
eustacia
was
melting
to
nothing
and
the
fair
woman
herself
was
standing
on
rainbarrow
her
soul
in
an
abyss
of
desolation
seldom
plumbed
by
one
so
young
yeobright
sat
lonely
at
blooms
end
he
had
fulfilled
his
word
to
thomasin
by
sending
off
fairway
with
the
letter
to
his
wife
and
now
waited
with
increased
impatience
for
some
sound
or
signal
of
her
return
were
eustacia
still
at
mistover
the
very
least
he
expected
was
that
she
would
send
him
back
a
reply
tonight
by
the
same
hand
though
to
leave
all
to
her
inclination
he
had
cautioned
fairway
not
to
ask
for
an
answer
if
one
were
handed
to
him
he
was
to
bring
it
immediately
if
not
he
was
to
go
straight
home
without
troubling
to
come
round
to
blooms
end
again
that
night
but
secretly
clym
had
a
more
pleasing
hope
eustacia
might
possibly
decline
to
use
her
pen
it
was
rather
her
way
to
work
silently
and
surprise
him
by
appearing
at
his
door
how
fully
her
mind
was
made
up
to
do
otherwise
he
did
not
know
to
clym
s
regret
it
began
to
rain
and
blow
hard
as
the
evening
advanced
the
wind
rasped
and
scraped
at
the
corners
of
the
house
and
filliped
the
eavesdroppings
like
peas
against
the
panes
he
walked
restlessly
about
the
untenanted
rooms
stopping
strange
noises
in
windows
and
doors
by
jamming
splinters
of
wood
into
the
casements
and
crevices
and
pressing
together
the
leadwork
of
the
quarries
where
it
had
become
loosened
from
the
glass
it
was
one
of
those
nights
when
cracks
in
the
walls
of
old
churches
widen
when
ancient
stains
on
the
ceilings
of
decayed
manor
houses
are
renewed
and
enlarged
from
the
size
of
a
man
s
hand
to
an
area
of
many
feet
the
little
gate
in
the
palings
before
his
dwelling
continually
opened
and
clicked
together
again
but
when
he
looked
out
eagerly
nobody
was
there
it
was
as
if
invisible
shapes
of
the
dead
were
passing
in
on
their
way
to
visit
him
between
ten
and
eleven
o
clock
finding
that
neither
fairway
nor
anybody
else
came
to
him
he
retired
to
rest
and
despite
his
anxieties
soon
fell
asleep
his
sleep
however
was
not
very
sound
by
reason
of
the
expectancy
he
had
given
way
to
and
he
was
easily
awakened
by
a
knocking
which
began
at
the
door
about
an
hour
after
clym
arose
and
looked
out
of
the
window
rain
was
still
falling
heavily
the
whole
expanse
of
heath
before
him
emitting
a
subdued
hiss
under
the
downpour
it
was
too
dark
to
see
anything
at
all
who
s
there
he
cried
light
footsteps
shifted
their
position
in
the
porch
and
he
could
just
distinguish
in
a
plaintive
female
voice
the
words
o
clym
come
down
and
let
me
in
he
flushed
hot
with
agitation
surely
it
is
eustacia
he
murmured
if
so
she
had
indeed
come
to
him
unawares
he
hastily
got
a
light
dressed
himself
and
went
down
on
his
flinging
open
the
door
the
rays
of
the
candle
fell
upon
a
woman
closely
wrapped
up
who
at
once
came
forward
thomasin
he
exclaimed
in
an
indescribable
tone
of
disappointment
it
is
thomasin
and
on
such
a
night
as
this
o
where
is
eustacia
thomasin
it
was
wet
frightened
and
panting
eustacia
i
don
t
know
clym
but
i
can
think
she
said
with
much
perturbation
let
me
come
in
and
rest
i
will
explain
this
there
is
a
great
trouble
brewing
my
husband
and
eustacia
what
what
i
think
my
husband
is
going
to
leave
me
or
do
something
dreadful
i
don
t
know
what
clym
will
you
go
and
see
i
have
nobody
to
help
me
but
you
eustacia
has
not
yet
come
home
no
she
went
on
breathlessly
then
they
are
going
to
run
off
together
he
came
indoors
tonight
about
eight
o
clock
and
said
in
an
off
hand
way
tamsie
i
have
just
found
that
i
must
go
a
journey
when
i
said
tonight
he
said
where
i
asked
him
i
cannot
tell
you
at
present
he
said
i
shall
be
back
again
tomorrow
he
then
went
and
busied
himself
in
looking
up
his
things
and
took
no
notice
of
me
at
all
i
expected
to
see
him
start
but
he
did
not
and
then
it
came
to
be
ten
o
clock
when
he
said
you
had
better
go
to
bed
i
didn
t
know
what
to
do
and
i
went
to
bed
i
believe
he
thought
i
fell
asleep
for
half
an
hour
after
that
he
came
up
and
unlocked
the
oak
chest
we
keep
money
in
when
we
have
much
in
the
house
and
took
out
a
roll
of
something
which
i
believe
was
banknotes
though
i
was
not
aware
that
he
had
em
there
these
he
must
have
got
from
the
bank
when
he
went
there
the
other
day
what
does
he
want
banknotes
for
if
he
is
only
going
off
for
a
day
when
he
had
gone
down
i
thought
of
eustacia
and
how
he
had
met
her
the
night
before
i
know
he
did
meet
her
clym
for
i
followed
him
part
of
the
way
but
i
did
not
like
to
tell
you
when
you
called
and
so
make
you
think
ill
of
him
as
i
did
not
think
it
was
so
serious
then
i
could
not
stay
in
bed
i
got
up
and
dressed
myself
and
when
i
heard
him
out
in
the
stable
i
thought
i
would
come
and
tell
you
so
i
came
downstairs
without
any
noise
and
slipped
out
then
he
was
not
absolutely
gone
when
you
left
no
will
you
dear
cousin
clym
go
and
try
to
persuade
him
not
to
go
he
takes
no
notice
of
what
i
say
and
puts
me
off
with
the
story
of
his
going
on
a
journey
and
will
be
home
tomorrow
and
all
that
but
i
don
t
believe
it
i
think
you
could
influence
him
i
ll
go
said
clym
o
eustacia
thomasin
carried
in
her
arms
a
large
bundle
and
having
by
this
time
seated
herself
she
began
to
unroll
it
when
a
baby
appeared
as
the
kernel
to
the
husks
dry
warm
and
unconscious
of
travel
or
rough
weather
thomasin
briefly
kissed
the
baby
and
then
found
time
to
begin
crying
as
she
said
i
brought
baby
for
i
was
afraid
what
might
happen
to
her
i
suppose
it
will
be
her
death
but
i
couldn
t
leave
her
with
rachel
clym
hastily
put
together
the
logs
on
the
hearth
raked
abroad
the
embers
which
were
scarcely
yet
extinct
and
blew
up
a
flame
with
the
bellows
dry
yourself
he
said
i
ll
go
and
get
some
more
wood
no
no
don
t
stay
for
that
i
ll
make
up
the
fire
will
you
go
at
once
please
will
you
yeobright
ran
upstairs
to
finish
dressing
himself
while
he
was
gone
another
rapping
came
to
the
door
this
time
there
was
no
delusion
that
it
might
be
eustacia
s
the
footsteps
just
preceding
it
had
been
heavy
and
slow
yeobright
thinking
it
might
possibly
be
fairway
with
a
note
in
answer
descended
again
and
opened
the
door
captain
vye
he
said
to
a
dripping
figure

my
granddaughter

said
the
captain

then
where

t
know
but
you

to
know

clym
with
rising
excitement

just
going
to
look
to

house

about
half
an
hour
ago
who

sitting
there
my
cousin
thomasin
the
captain
bowed
in
a
preoccupied
way
to
her
i
only
hope
it
is
no
worse
than
an
elopement
he
said
worse
what
s
worse
than
the
worst
a
wife
can
do
well
i
have
been
told
a
strange
tale
before
starting
in
search
of
her
i
called
up
charley
my
stable
lad
i
missed
my
pistols
the
other
day
pistols
he
said
at
the
time
that
he
took
them
down
to
clean
he
has
now
owned
that
he
took
them
because
he
saw
eustacia
looking
curiously
at
them
and
she
afterwards
owned
to
him
that
she
was
thinking
of
taking
her
life
but
bound
him
to
secrecy
and
promised
never
to
think
of
such
a
thing
again
i
hardly
suppose
she
will
ever
have
bravado
enough
to
use
one
of
them
but
it
shows
what
has
been
lurking
in
her
mind
and
people
who
think
of
that
sort
of
thing
once
think
of
it
again
where
are
the
pistols
safely
locked
up
o
no
she
won
t
touch
them
again
but
there
are
more
ways
of
letting
out
life
than
through
a
bullet
hole
what
did
you
quarrel
about
so
bitterly
with
her
to
drive
her
to
all
this
you
must
have
treated
her
badly
indeed
well
i
was
always
against
the
marriage
and
i
was
right
are
you
going
with
me
said
yeobright
paying
no
attention
to
the
captain
s
latter
remark
if
so
i
can
tell
you
what
we
quarrelled
about
as
we
walk
along
where
to
to
wildeve
s
that
was
her
destination
depend
upon
it
thomasin
here
broke
in
still
weeping
he
said
he
was
only
going
on
a
sudden
short
journey
but
if
so
why
did
he
want
so
much
money
o
clym
what
do
you
think
will
happen
i
am
afraid
that
you
my
poor
baby
will
soon
have
no
father
left
to
you
i
am
off
now
said
yeobright
stepping
into
the
porch
i
would
fain
go
with
ee
said
the
old
man
doubtfully
but
i
begin
to
be
afraid
that
my
legs
will
hardly
carry
me
there
such
a
night
as
this
i
am
not
so
young
as
i
was
if
they
are
interrupted
in
their
flight
she
will
be
sure
to
come
back
to
me
and
i
ought
to
be
at
the
house
to
receive
her
but
be
it
as
twill
i
can
t
walk
to
the
quiet
woman
and
that
s
an
end
on
t
i
ll
go
straight
home
it
will
perhaps
be
best
said
clym
thomasin
dry
yourself
and
be
as
comfortable
as
you
can
with
this
he
closed
the
door
upon
her
and
left
the
house
in
company
with
captain
vye
who
parted
from
him
outside
the
gate
taking
the
middle
path
which
led
to
mistover
clym
crossed
by
the
right
hand
track
towards
the
inn
thomasin
being
left
alone
took
off
some
of
her
wet
garments
carried
the
baby
upstairs
to
clym
s
bed
and
then
came
down
to
the
sitting
room
again
where
she
made
a
larger
fire
and
began
drying
herself
the
fire
soon
flared
up
the
chimney
giving
the
room
an
appearance
of
comfort
that
was
doubled
by
contrast
with
the
drumming
of
the
storm
without
which
snapped
at
the
windowpanes
and
breathed
into
the
chimney
strange
low
utterances
that
seemed
to
be
the
prologue
to
some
tragedy
but
the
least
part
of
thomasin
was
in
the
house
for
her
heart
being
at
ease
about
the
little
girl
upstairs
she
was
mentally
following
clym
on
his
journey
having
indulged
in
this
imaginary
peregrination
for
some
considerable
interval
she
became
impressed
with
a
sense
of
the
intolerable
slowness
of
time
but
she
sat
on
the
moment
then
came
when
she
could
scarcely
sit
longer
and
it
was
like
a
satire
on
her
patience
to
remember
that
clym
could
hardly
have
reached
the
inn
as
yet
at
last
she
went
to
the
baby
s
bedside
the
child
was
sleeping
soundly
but
her
imagination
of
possibly
disastrous
events
at
her
home
the
predominance
within
her
of
the
unseen
over
the
seen
agitated
her
beyond
endurance
she
could
not
refrain
from
going
down
and
opening
the
door
the
rain
still
continued
the
candlelight
falling
upon
the
nearest
drops
and
making
glistening
darts
of
them
as
they
descended
across
the
throng
of
invisible
ones
behind
to
plunge
into
that
medium
was
to
plunge
into
water
slightly
diluted
with
air
but
the
difficulty
of
returning
to
her
house
at
this
moment
made
her
all
the
more
desirous
of
doing
so
anything
was
better
than
suspense
i
have
come
here
well
enough
she
said
and
why
shouldn
t
i
go
back
again
it
is
a
mistake
for
me
to
be
away
she
hastily
fetched
the
infant
wrapped
it
up
cloaked
herself
as
before
and
shoveling
the
ashes
over
the
fire
to
prevent
accidents
went
into
the
open
air
pausing
first
to
put
the
door
key
in
its
old
place
behind
the
shutter
she
resolutely
turned
her
face
to
the
confronting
pile
of
firmamental
darkness
beyond
the
palings
and
stepped
into
its
midst
but
thomasin
s
imagination
being
so
actively
engaged
elsewhere
the
night
and
the
weather
had
for
her
no
terror
beyond
that
of
their
actual
discomfort
and
difficulty
she
was
soon
ascending
blooms
end
valley
and
traversing
the
undulations
on
the
side
of
the
hill
the
noise
of
the
wind
over
the
heath
was
shrill
and
as
if
it
whistled
for
joy
at
finding
a
night
so
congenial
as
this
sometimes
the
path
led
her
to
hollows
between
thickets
of
tall
and
dripping
bracken
dead
though
not
yet
prostrate
which
enclosed
her
like
a
pool
when
they
were
more
than
usually
tall
she
lifted
the
baby
to
the
top
of
her
head
that
it
might
be
out
of
the
reach
of
their
drenching
fronds
on
higher
ground
where
the
wind
was
brisk
and
sustained
the
rain
flew
in
a
level
flight
without
sensible
descent
so
that
it
was
beyond
all
power
to
imagine
the
remoteness
of
the
point
at
which
it
left
the
bosoms
of
the
clouds
here
self
defence
was
impossible
and
individual
drops
stuck
into
her
like
the
arrows
into
saint
sebastian
she
was
enabled
to
avoid
puddles
by
the
nebulous
paleness
which
signified
their
presence
though
beside
anything
less
dark
than
the
heath
they
themselves
would
have
appeared
as
blackness
yet
in
spite
of
all
this
thomasin
was
not
sorry
that
she
had
started
to
her
there
were
not
as
to
eustacia
demons
in
the
air
and
malice
in
every
bush
and
bough
the
drops
which
lashed
her
face
were
not
scorpions
but
prosy
rain
egdon
in
the
mass
was
no
monster
whatever
but
impersonal
open
ground
her
fears
of
the
place
were
rational
her
dislikes
of
its
worst
moods
reasonable
at
this
time
it
was
in
her
view
a
windy
wet
place
in
which
a
person
might
experience
much
discomfort
lose
the
path
without
care
and
possibly
catch
cold
if
the
path
is
well
known
the
difficulty
at
such
times
of
keeping
therein
is
not
altogether
great
from
its
familiar
feel
to
the
feet
but
once
lost
it
is
irrecoverable
owing
to
her
baby
who
somewhat
impeded
thomasin
s
view
forward
and
distracted
her
mind
she
did
at
last
lose
the
track
this
mishap
occurred
when
she
was
descending
an
open
slope
about
two
thirds
home
instead
of
attempting
by
wandering
hither
and
thither
the
hopeless
task
of
finding
such
a
mere
thread
she
went
straight
on
trusting
for
guidance
to
her
general
knowledge
of
the
contours
which
was
scarcely
surpassed
by
clym
s
or
by
that
of
the
heath
croppers
themselves
at
length
thomasin
reached
a
hollow
and
began
to
discern
through
the
rain
a
faint
blotted
radiance
which
presently
assumed
the
oblong
form
of
an
open
door
she
knew
that
no
house
stood
hereabouts
and
was
soon
aware
of
the
nature
of
the
door
by
its
height
above
the
ground
why
it
is
diggory
venn
s
van
surely
she
said
a
certain
secluded
spot
near
rainbarrow
was
she
knew
often
venn
s
chosen
centre
when
staying
in
this
neighbourhood
and
she
guessed
at
once
that
she
had
stumbled
upon
this
mysterious
retreat
the
question
arose
in
her
mind
whether
or
not
she
should
ask
him
to
guide
her
into
the
path
in
her
anxiety
to
reach
home
she
decided
that
she
would
appeal
to
him
notwithstanding
the
strangeness
of
appearing
before
his
eyes
at
this
place
and
season
but
when
in
pursuance
of
this
resolve
thomasin
reached
the
van
and
looked
in
she
found
it
to
be
untenanted
though
there
was
no
doubt
that
it
was
the
reddleman
s
the
fire
was
burning
in
the
stove
the
lantern
hung
from
the
nail
round
the
doorway
the
floor
was
merely
sprinkled
with
rain
and
not
saturated
which
told
her
that
the
door
had
not
long
been
opened
while
she
stood
uncertainly
looking
in
thomasin
heard
a
footstep
advancing
from
the
darkness
behind
her
and
turning
beheld
the
well
known
form
in
corduroy
lurid
from
head
to
foot
the
lantern
beams
falling
upon
him
through
an
intervening
gauze
of
raindrops
i
thought
you
went
down
the
slope
he
said
without
noticing
her
face
how
do
you
come
back
here
again
diggory
said
thomasin
faintly
who
are
you
said
venn
still
unperceiving
and
why
were
you
crying
so
just
now
o
diggory
don
t
you
know
me
said
she
but
of
course
you
don
t
wrapped
up
like
this
what
do
you
mean
i
have
not
been
crying
here
and
i
have
not
been
here
before
venn
then
came
nearer
till
he
could
see
the
illuminated
side
of
her
form
mrs
wildeve
he
exclaimed
starting
what
a
time
for
us
to
meet
and
the
baby
too
what
dreadful
thing
can
have
brought
you
out
on
such
a
night
as
this
she
could
not
immediately
answer
and
without
asking
her
permission
he
hopped
into
his
van
took
her
by
the
arm
and
drew
her
up
after
him
what
is
it
he
continued
when
they
stood
within
i
have
lost
my
way
coming
from
blooms
end
and
i
am
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
home
please
show
me
as
quickly
as
you
can
it
is
so
silly
of
me
not
to
know
egdon
better
and
i
cannot
think
how
i
came
to
lose
the
path
show
me
quickly
diggory
please
yes
of
course
i
will
go
with
ee
but
you
came
to
me
before
this
mrs
wildeve
i
only
came
this
minute
that
s
strange
i
was
lying
down
here
asleep
about
five
minutes
ago
with
the
door
shut
to
keep
out
the
weather
when
the
brushing
of
a
woman
s
clothes
over
the
heath
bushes
just
outside
woke
me
up
for
i
don
t
sleep
heavy
and
at
the
same
time
i
heard
a
sobbing
or
crying
from
the
same
woman
i
opened
my
door
and
held
out
my
lantern
and
just
as
far
as
the
light
would
reach
i
saw
a
woman
she
turned
her
head
when
the
light
sheened
on
her
and
then
hurried
on
downhill
i
hung
up
the
lantern
and
was
curious
enough
to
pull
on
my
things
and
dog
her
a
few
steps
but
i
could
see
nothing
of
her
any
more
that
was
where
i
had
been
when
you
came
up
and
when
i
saw
you
i
thought
you
were
the
same
one
perhaps
it
was
one
of
the
heathfolk
going
home
no
it
couldn
t
be
tis
too
late
the
noise
of
her
gown
over
the
he
th
was
of
a
whistling
sort
that
nothing
but
silk
will
make
it
wasn
t
i
then
my
dress
is
not
silk
you
see
are
we
anywhere
in
a
line
between
mistover
and
the
inn
well
yes
not
far
out
ah
i
wonder
if
it
was
she
diggory
i
must
go
at
once
she
jumped
down
from
the
van
before
he
was
aware
when
venn
unhooked
the
lantern
and
leaped
down
after
her
i
ll
take
the
baby
ma
am
he
said
you
must
be
tired
out
by
the
weight
thomasin
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
delivered
the
baby
into
venn
s
hands
don
t
squeeze
her
diggory
she
said
or
hurt
her
little
arm
and
keep
the
cloak
close
over
her
like
this
so
that
the
rain
may
not
drop
in
her
face
i
will
said
venn
earnestly
as
if
i
could
hurt
anything
belonging
to
you
i
only
meant
accidentally
said
thomasin
the
baby
is
dry
enough
but
you
are
pretty
wet
said
the
reddleman
when
in
closing
the
door
of
his
cart
to
padlock
it
he
noticed
on
the
floor
a
ring
of
water
drops
where
her
cloak
had
hung
from
her
thomasin
followed
him
as
he
wound
right
and
left
to
avoid
the
larger
bushes
stopping
occasionally
and
covering
the
lantern
while
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
to
gain
some
idea
of
the
position
of
rainbarrow
above
them
which
it
was
necessary
to
keep
directly
behind
their
backs
to
preserve
a
proper
course
you
are
sure
the
rain
does
not
fall
upon
baby
quite
sure
may
i
ask
how
old
he
is
ma
am
he
said
thomasin
reproachfully
anybody
can
see
better
than
that
in
a
moment
she
is
nearly
two
months
old
how
far
is
it
now
to
the
inn
a
little
over
a
quarter
of
a
mile
will
you
walk
a
little
faster
i
was
afraid
you
could
not
keep
up
i
am
very
anxious
to
get
there
ah
there
is
a
light
from
the
window
tis
not
from
the
window
that
s
a
gig
lamp
to
the
best
of
my
belief
o
said
thomasin
in
despair
i
wish
i
had
been
there
sooner
give
me
the
baby
diggory
you
can
go
back
now
i
must
go
all
the
way
said
venn
there
is
a
quag
between
us
and
that
light
and
you
will
walk
into
it
up
to
your
neck
unless
i
take
you
round
but
the
light
is
at
the
inn
and
there
is
no
quag
in
front
of
that
no
the
light
is
below
the
inn
some
two
or
three
hundred
yards
never
mind
said
thomasin
hurriedly
go
towards
the
light
and
not
towards
the
inn
yes
answered
venn
swerving
round
in
obedience
and
after
a
pause
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
what
this
great
trouble
is
i
think
you
have
proved
that
i
can
be
trusted
there
are
some
things
that
cannot
be
cannot
be
told
to
and
then
her
heart
rose
into
her
throat
and
she
could
say
no
more
sights
and
sounds
draw
the
wanderers
together
having
seen
eustacia
s
signal
from
the
hill
at
eight
o
clock
wildeve
immediately
prepared
to
assist
her
in
her
flight
and
as
he
hoped
accompany
her
he
was
somewhat
perturbed
and
his
manner
of
informing
thomasin
that
he
was
going
on
a
journey
was
in
itself
sufficient
to
rouse
her
suspicions
when
she
had
gone
to
bed
he
collected
the
few
articles
he
would
require
and
went
upstairs
to
the
money
chest
whence
he
took
a
tolerably
bountiful
sum
in
notes
which
had
been
advanced
to
him
on
the
property
he
was
so
soon
to
have
in
possession
to
defray
expenses
incidental
to
the
removal
he
then
went
to
the
stable
and
coach
house
to
assure
himself
that
the
horse
gig
and
harness
were
in
a
fit
condition
for
a
long
drive
nearly
half
an
hour
was
spent
thus
and
on
returning
to
the
house
wildeve
had
no
thought
of
thomasin
being
anywhere
but
in
bed
he
had
told
the
stable
lad
not
to
stay
up
leading
the
boy
to
understand
that
his
departure
would
be
at
three
or
four
in
the
morning
for
this
though
an
exceptional
hour
was
less
strange
than
midnight
the
time
actually
agreed
on
the
packet
from
budmouth
sailing
between
one
and
two
at
last
all
was
quiet
and
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
wait
by
no
effort
could
he
shake
off
the
oppression
of
spirits
which
he
had
experienced
ever
since
his
last
meeting
with
eustacia
but
he
hoped
there
was
that
in
his
situation
which
money
could
cure
he
had
persuaded
himself
that
to
act
not
ungenerously
towards
his
gentle
wife
by
settling
on
her
the
half
of
his
property
and
with
chivalrous
devotion
towards
another
and
greater
woman
by
sharing
her
fate
was
possible
and
though
he
meant
to
adhere
to
eustacia
s
instructions
to
the
letter
to
deposit
her
where
she
wished
and
to
leave
her
should
that
be
her
will
the
spell
that
she
had
cast
over
him
intensified
and
his
heart
was
beating
fast
in
the
anticipated
futility
of
such
commands
in
the
face
of
a
mutual
wish
that
they
should
throw
in
their
lot
together
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
dwell
long
upon
these
conjectures
maxims
and
hopes
and
at
twenty
minutes
to
twelve
he
again
went
softly
to
the
stable
harnessed
the
horse
and
lit
the
lamps
whence
taking
the
horse
by
the
head
he
led
him
with
the
covered
car
out
of
the
yard
to
a
spot
by
the
roadside
some
quarter
of
a
mile
below
the
inn
here
wildeve
waited
slightly
sheltered
from
the
driving
rain
by
a
high
bank
that
had
been
cast
up
at
this
place
along
the
surface
of
the
road
where
lit
by
the
lamps
the
loosened
gravel
and
small
stones
scudded
and
clicked
together
before
the
wind
which
leaving
them
in
heaps
plunged
into
the
heath
and
boomed
across
the
bushes
into
darkness
only
one
sound
rose
above
this
din
of
weather
and
that
was
the
roaring
of
a
ten
hatch
weir
to
the
southward
from
a
river
in
the
meads
which
formed
the
boundary
of
the
heath
in
this
direction
he
lingered
on
in
perfect
stillness
till
he
began
to
fancy
that
the
midnight
hour
must
have
struck
a
very
strong
doubt
had
arisen
in
his
mind
if
eustacia
would
venture
down
the
hill
in
such
weather
yet
knowing
her
nature
he
felt
that
she
might
poor
thing
tis
like
her
ill
luck
he
murmured
at
length
he
turned
to
the
lamp
and
looked
at
his
watch
to
his
surprise
it
was
nearly
a
quarter
past
midnight
he
now
wished
that
he
had
driven
up
the
circuitous
road
to
mistover
a
plan
not
adopted
because
of
the
enormous
length
of
the
route
in
proportion
to
that
of
the
pedestrian
s
path
down
the
open
hillside
and
the
consequent
increase
of
labour
for
the
horse
at
this
moment
a
footstep
approached
but
the
light
of
the
lamps
being
in
a
different
direction
the
comer
was
not
visible
the
step
paused
then
came
on
again
eustacia
said
wildeve
the
person
came
forward
and
the
light
fell
upon
the
form
of
clym
glistening
with
wet
whom
wildeve
immediately
recognized
but
wildeve
who
stood
behind
the
lamp
was
not
at
once
recognized
by
yeobright
he
stopped
as
if
in
doubt
whether
this
waiting
vehicle
could
have
anything
to
do
with
the
flight
of
his
wife
or
not
the
sight
of
yeobright
at
once
banished
wildeve
s
sober
feelings
who
saw
him
again
as
the
deadly
rival
from
whom
eustacia
was
to
be
kept
at
all
hazards
hence
wildeve
did
not
speak
in
the
hope
that
clym
would
pass
by
without
particular
inquiry
while
they
both
hung
thus
in
hesitation
a
dull
sound
became
audible
above
the
storm
and
wind
its
origin
was
unmistakable
it
was
the
fall
of
a
body
into
the
stream
in
the
adjoining
mead
apparently
at
a
point
near
the
weir
both
started
good
god
can
it
be
she
said
clym
why
should
it
be
she
said
wildeve
in
his
alarm
forgetting
that
he
had
hitherto
screened
himself
ah
that
s
you
you
traitor
is
it
cried
yeobright
why
should
it
be
she
because
last
week
she
would
have
put
an
end
to
her
life
if
she
had
been
able
she
ought
to
have
been
watched
take
one
of
the
lamps
and
come
with
me
yeobright
seized
the
one
on
his
side
and
hastened
on
wildeve
did
not
wait
to
unfasten
the
other
but
followed
at
once
along
the
meadow
track
to
the
weir
a
little
in
the
rear
of
clym
shadwater
weir
had
at
its
foot
a
large
circular
pool
fifty
feet
in
diameter
into
which
the
water
flowed
through
ten
huge
hatches
raised
and
lowered
by
a
winch
and
cogs
in
the
ordinary
manner
the
sides
of
the
pool
were
of
masonry
to
prevent
the
water
from
washing
away
the
bank
but
the
force
of
the
stream
in
winter
was
sometimes
such
as
to
undermine
the
retaining
wall
and
precipitate
it
into
the
hole
clym
reached
the
hatches
the
framework
of
which
was
shaken
to
its
foundations
by
the
velocity
of
the
current
nothing
but
the
froth
of
the
waves
could
be
discerned
in
the
pool
below
he
got
upon
the
plank
bridge
over
the
race
and
holding
to
the
rail
that
the
wind
might
not
blow
him
off
crossed
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
there
he
leant
over
the
wall
and
lowered
the
lamp
only
to
behold
the
vortex
formed
at
the
curl
of
the
returning
current
wildeve
meanwhile
had
arrived
on
the
former
side
and
the
light
from
yeobright
s
lamp
shed
a
flecked
and
agitated
radiance
across
the
weir
pool
revealing
to
the
ex
engineer
the
tumbling
courses
of
the
currents
from
the
hatches
above
across
this
gashed
and
puckered
mirror
a
dark
body
was
slowly
borne
by
one
of
the
backward
currents
o
my
darling
exclaimed
wildeve
in
an
agonized
voice
and
without
showing
sufficient
presence
of
mind
even
to
throw
off
his
greatcoat
he
leaped
into
the
boiling
caldron
yeobright
could
now
also
discern
the
floating
body
though
but
indistinctly
and
imagining
from
wildeve
s
plunge
that
there
was
life
to
be
saved
he
was
about
to
leap
after
bethinking
himself
of
a
wiser
plan
he
placed
the
lamp
against
a
post
to
make
it
stand
upright
and
running
round
to
the
lower
part
of
the
pool
where
there
was
no
wall
he
sprang
in
and
boldly
waded
upwards
towards
the
deeper
portion
here
he
was
taken
off
his
legs
and
in
swimming
was
carried
round
into
the
centre
of
the
basin
where
he
perceived
wildeve
struggling
while
these
hasty
actions
were
in
progress
here
venn
and
thomasin
had
been
toiling
through
the
lower
corner
of
the
heath
in
the
direction
of
the
light
they
had
not
been
near
enough
to
the
river
to
hear
the
plunge
but
they
saw
the
removal
of
the
carriage
lamp
and
watched
its
motion
into
the
mead
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
car
and
horse
venn
guessed
that
something
new
was
amiss
and
hastened
to
follow
in
the
course
of
the
moving
light
venn
walked
faster
than
thomasin
and
came
to
the
weir
alone
the
lamp
placed
against
the
post
by
clym
still
shone
across
the
water
and
the
reddleman
observed
something
floating
motionless
being
encumbered
with
the
infant
he
ran
back
to
meet
thomasin
take
the
baby
please
mrs
wildeve
he
said
hastily
run
home
with
her
call
the
stable
lad
and
make
him
send
down
to
me
any
men
who
may
be
living
near
somebody
has
fallen
into
the
weir
thomasin
took
the
child
and
ran
when
she
came
to
the
covered
car
the
horse
though
fresh
from
the
stable
was
standing
perfectly
still
as
if
conscious
of
misfortune
she
saw
for
the
first
time
whose
it
was
she
nearly
fainted
and
would
have
been
unable
to
proceed
another
step
but
that
the
necessity
of
preserving
the
little
girl
from
harm
nerved
her
to
an
amazing
self
control
in
this
agony
of
suspense
she
entered
the
house
put
the
baby
in
a
place
of
safety
woke
the
lad
and
the
female
domestic
and
ran
out
to
give
the
alarm
at
the
nearest
cottage
diggory
having
returned
to
the
brink
of
the
pool
observed
that
the
small
upper
hatches
or
floats
were
withdrawn
he
found
one
of
these
lying
upon
the
grass
and
taking
it
under
one
arm
and
with
his
lantern
in
his
hand
entered
at
the
bottom
of
the
pool
as
clym
had
done
as
soon
as
he
began
to
be
in
deep
water
he
flung
himself
across
the
hatch
thus
supported
he
was
able
to
keep
afloat
as
long
as
he
chose
holding
the
lantern
aloft
with
his
disengaged
hand
propelled
by
his
feet
he
steered
round
and
round
the
pool
ascending
each
time
by
one
of
the
back
streams
and
descending
in
the
middle
of
the
current
at
first
he
could
see
nothing
then
amidst
the
glistening
of
the
whirlpools
and
the
white
clots
of
foam
he
distinguished
a
woman
s
bonnet
floating
alone
his
search
was
now
under
the
left
wall
when
something
came
to
the
surface
almost
close
beside
him
it
was
not
as
he
had
expected
a
woman
but
a
man
the
reddleman
put
the
ring
of
the
lantern
between
his
teeth
seized
the
floating
man
by
the
collar
and
holding
on
to
the
hatch
with
his
remaining
arm
struck
out
into
the
strongest
race
by
which
the
unconscious
man
the
hatch
and
himself
were
carried
down
the
stream
as
soon
as
venn
found
his
feet
dragging
over
the
pebbles
of
the
shallower
part
below
he
secured
his
footing
and
waded
towards
the
brink
there
where
the
water
stood
at
about
the
height
of
his
waist
he
flung
away
the
hatch
and
attempted
to
drag
forth
the
man
this
was
a
matter
of
great
difficulty
and
he
found
as
the
reason
that
the
legs
of
the
unfortunate
stranger
were
tightly
embraced
by
the
arms
of
another
man
who
had
hitherto
been
entirely
beneath
the
surface
at
this
moment
his
heart
bounded
to
hear
footsteps
running
towards
him
and
two
men
roused
by
thomasin
appeared
at
the
brink
above
they
ran
to
where
venn
was
and
helped
him
in
lifting
out
the
apparently
drowned
persons
separating
them
and
laying
them
out
upon
the
grass
venn
turned
the
light
upon
their
faces
the
one
who
had
been
uppermost
was
yeobright
he
who
had
been
completely
submerged
was
wildeve
now
we
must
search
the
hole
again
said
venn
a
woman
is
in
there
somewhere
get
a
pole
one
of
the
men
went
to
the
footbridge
and
tore
off
the
handrail
the
reddleman
and
the
two
others
then
entered
the
water
together
from
below
as
before
and
with
their
united
force
probed
the
pool
forwards
to
where
it
sloped
down
to
its
central
depth
venn
was
not
mistaken
in
supposing
that
any
person
who
had
sunk
for
the
last
time
would
be
washed
down
to
this
point
for
when
they
had
examined
to
about
halfway
across
something
impeded
their
thrust
pull
it
forward
said
venn
and
they
raked
it
in
with
the
pole
till
it
was
close
to
their
feet
venn
vanished
under
the
stream
and
came
up
with
an
armful
of
wet
drapery
enclosing
a
woman
s
cold
form
which
was
all
that
remained
of
the
desperate
eustacia
when
they
reached
the
bank
there
stood
thomasin
in
a
stress
of
grief
bending
over
the
two
unconscious
ones
who
already
lay
there
the
horse
and
cart
were
brought
to
the
nearest
point
in
the
road
and
it
was
the
work
of
a
few
minutes
only
to
place
the
three
in
the
vehicle
venn
led
on
the
horse
supporting
thomasin
upon
his
arm
and
the
two
men
followed
till
they
reached
the
inn
the
woman
who
had
been
shaken
out
of
her
sleep
by
thomasin
had
hastily
dressed
herself
and
lighted
a
fire
the
other
servant
being
left
to
snore
on
in
peace
at
the
back
of
the
house
the
insensible
forms
of
eustacia
clym
and
wildeve
were
then
brought
in
and
laid
on
the
carpet
with
their
feet
to
the
fire
when
such
restorative
processes
as
could
be
thought
of
were
adopted
at
once
the
stableman
being
in
the
meantime
sent
for
a
doctor
but
there
seemed
to
be
not
a
whiff
of
life
in
either
of
the
bodies
then
thomasin
whose
stupor
of
grief
had
been
thrust
off
awhile
by
frantic
action
applied
a
bottle
of
hartshorn
to
clym
s
nostrils
having
tried
it
in
vain
upon
the
other
two
he
sighed
clym
s
alive
she
exclaimed
he
soon
breathed
distinctly
and
again
and
again
did
she
attempt
to
revive
her
husband
by
the
same
means
but
wildeve
gave
no
sign
there
was
too
much
reason
to
think
that
he
and
eustacia
both
were
for
ever
beyond
the
reach
of
stimulating
perfumes
their
exertions
did
not
relax
till
the
doctor
arrived
when
one
by
one
the
senseless
three
were
taken
upstairs
and
put
into
warm
beds
venn
soon
felt
himself
relieved
from
further
attendance
and
went
to
the
door
scarcely
able
yet
to
realize
the
strange
catastrophe
that
had
befallen
the
family
in
which
he
took
so
great
an
interest
thomasin
surely
would
be
broken
down
by
the
sudden
and
overwhelming
nature
of
this
event
no
firm
and
sensible
mrs
yeobright
lived
now
to
support
the
gentle
girl
through
the
ordeal
and
whatever
an
unimpassioned
spectator
might
think
of
her
loss
of
such
a
husband
as
wildeve
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
for
the
moment
she
was
distracted
and
horrified
by
the
blow
as
for
himself
not
being
privileged
to
go
to
her
and
comfort
her
he
saw
no
reason
for
waiting
longer
in
a
house
where
he
remained
only
as
a
stranger
he
returned
across
the
heath
to
his
van
the
fire
was
not
yet
out
and
everything
remained
as
he
had
left
it
venn
now
bethought
himself
of
his
clothes
which
were
saturated
with
water
to
the
weight
of
lead
he
changed
them
spread
them
before
the
fire
and
lay
down
to
sleep
but
it
was
more
than
he
could
do
to
rest
here
while
excited
by
a
vivid
imagination
of
the
turmoil
they
were
in
at
the
house
he
had
quitted
and
blaming
himself
for
coming
away
he
dressed
in
another
suit
locked
up
the
door
and
again
hastened
across
to
the
inn
rain
was
still
falling
heavily
when
he
entered
the
kitchen
a
bright
fire
was
shining
from
the
hearth
and
two
women
were
bustling
about
one
of
whom
was
olly
dowden
well
how
is
it
going
on
now
said
venn
in
a
whisper
mr
yeobright
is
better
but
mrs
yeobright
and
mr
wildeve
are
dead
and
cold
the
doctor
says
they
were
quite
gone
before
they
were
out
of
the
water
ah
i
thought
as
much
when
i
hauled
em
up
and
mrs
wildeve
she
is
as
well
as
can
be
expected
the
doctor
had
her
put
between
blankets
for
she
was
almost
as
wet
as
they
that
had
been
in
the
river
poor
young
thing
you
don
t
seem
very
dry
reddleman
oh
tis
not
much
i
have
changed
my
things
this
is
only
a
little
dampness
i
ve
got
coming
through
the
rain
again
stand
by
the
fire
mis
ess
says
you
be
to
have
whatever
you
want
and
she
was
sorry
when
she
was
told
that
you
d
gone
away
venn
drew
near
to
the
fireplace
and
looked
into
the
flames
in
an
absent
mood
the
steam
came
from
his
leggings
and
ascended
the
chimney
with
the
smoke
while
he
thought
of
those
who
were
upstairs
two
were
corpses
one
had
barely
escaped
the
jaws
of
death
another
was
sick
and
a
widow
the
last
occasion
on
which
he
had
lingered
by
that
fireplace
was
when
the
raffle
was
in
progress
when
wildeve
was
alive
and
well
thomasin
active
and
smiling
in
the
next
room
yeobright
and
eustacia
just
made
husband
and
wife
and
mrs
yeobright
living
at
blooms
end
it
had
seemed
at
that
time
that
the
then
position
of
affairs
was
good
for
at
least
twenty
years
to
come
yet
of
all
the
circle
he
himself
was
the
only
one
whose
situation
had
not
materially
changed
while
he
ruminated
a
footstep
descended
the
stairs
it
was
the
nurse
who
brought
in
her
hand
a
rolled
mass
of
wet
paper
the
woman
was
so
engrossed
with
her
occupation
that
she
hardly
saw
venn
she
took
from
a
cupboard
some
pieces
of
twine
which
she
strained
across
the
fireplace
tying
the
end
of
each
piece
to
the
firedog
previously
pulled
forward
for
the
purpose
and
unrolling
the
wet
papers
she
began
pinning
them
one
by
one
to
the
strings
in
a
manner
of
clothes

said

poor
master
s
banknotes
she
answered
they
were
found
in
his
pocket
when
they
undressed
him
then
he
was
not
coming
back
again
for
some
time
said
venn
that
we
shall
never
know
said
she
venn
was
loth
to
depart
for
all
on
earth
that
interested
him
lay
under
this
roof
as
nobody
in
the
house
had
any
more
sleep
that
night
except
the
two
who
slept
for
ever
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
remain
so
he
retired
into
the
niche
of
the
fireplace
where
he
had
used
to
sit
and
there
he
continued
watching
the
steam
from
the
double
row
of
banknotes
as
they
waved
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
draught
of
the
chimney
till
their
flaccidity
was
changed
to
dry
crispness
throughout
then
the
woman
came
and
unpinned
them
and
folding
them
together
carried
the
handful
upstairs
presently
the
doctor
appeared
from
above
with
the
look
of
a
man
who
could
do
no
more
and
pulling
on
his
gloves
went
out
of
the
house
the
trotting
of
his
horse
soon
dying
away
upon
the
road
at
four
o
clock
there
was
a
gentle
knock
at
the
door
it
was
from
charley
who
had
been
sent
by
captain
vye
to
inquire
if
anything
had
been
heard
of
eustacia
the
girl
who
admitted
him
looked
in
his
face
as
if
she
did
not
know
what
answer
to
return
and
showed
him
in
to
where
venn
was
seated
saying
to
the
reddleman
will
you
tell
him
please
venn
told
charley
s
only
utterance
was
a
feeble
indistinct
sound
he
stood
quite
still
then
he
burst
out
spasmodically
i
shall
see
her
once
more
i
dare
say
you
may
see
her
said
diggory
gravely
but
hadn
t
you
better
run
and
tell
captain
vye
yes
yes
only
i
do
hope
i
shall
see
her
just
once
again
you
shall
said
a
low
voice
behind
and
starting
round
they
beheld
by
the
dim
light
a
thin
pallid
almost
spectral
form
wrapped
in
a
blanket
and
looking
like
lazarus
coming
from
the
tomb
it
was
yeobright
neither
venn
nor
charley
spoke
and
clym
continued
you
shall
see
her
there
will
be
time
enough
to
tell
the
captain
when
it
gets
daylight
you
would
like
to
see
her
too
would
you
not
diggory
she
looks
very
beautiful
now
venn
assented
by
rising
to
his
feet
and
with
charley
he
followed
clym
to
the
foot
of
the
staircase
where
he
took
off
his
boots
charley
did
the
same
they
followed
yeobright
upstairs
to
the
landing
where
there
was
a
candle
burning
which
yeobright
took
in
his
hand
and
with
it
led
the
way
into
an
adjoining
room
here
he
went
to
the
bedside
and
folded
back
the
sheet
they
stood
silently
looking
upon
eustacia
who
as
she
lay
there
still
in
death
eclipsed
all
her
living
phases
pallor
did
not
include
all
the
quality
of
her
complexion
which
seemed
more
than
whiteness
it
was
almost
light
the
expression
of
her
finely
carved
mouth
was
pleasant
as
if
a
sense
of
dignity
had
just
compelled
her
to
leave
off
speaking
eternal
rigidity
had
seized
upon
it
in
a
momentary
transition
between
fervour
and
resignation
her
black
hair
was
looser
now
than
either
of
them
had
ever
seen
it
before
and
surrounded
her
brow
like
a
forest
the
stateliness
of
look
which
had
been
almost
too
marked
for
a
dweller
in
a
country
domicile
had
at
last
found
an
artistically
happy
background
nobody
spoke
till
at
length
clym
covered
her
and
turned
aside
now
come
here
he
said
they
went
to
a
recess
in
the
same
room
and
there
on
a
smaller
bed
lay
another
figure
wildeve
less
repose
was
visible
in
his
face
than
in
eustacia
s
but
the
same
luminous
youthfulness
overspread
it
and
the
least
sympathetic
observer
would
have
felt
at
sight
of
him
now
that
he
was
born
for
a
higher
destiny
than
this
the
only
sign
upon
him
of
his
recent
struggle
for
life
was
in
his
fingertips
which
were
worn
and
sacrificed
in
his
dying
endeavours
to
obtain
a
hold
on
the
face
of
the
weir
wall
yeobright
s
manner
had
been
so
quiet
he
had
uttered
so
few
syllables
since
his
reappearance
that
venn
imagined
him
resigned
it
was
only
when
they
had
left
the
room
and
stood
upon
the
landing
that
the
true
state
of
his
mind
was
apparent
here
he
said
with
a
wild
smile
inclining
his
head
towards
the
chamber
in
which
eustacia
lay
she
is
the
second
woman
i
have
killed
this
year
i
was
a
great
cause
of
my
mother
s
death
and
i
am
the
chief
cause
of
hers
how
said
venn
i
spoke
cruel
words
to
her
and
she
left
my
house
i
did
not
invite
her
back
till
it
was
too
late
it
is
i
who
ought
to
have
drowned
myself
it
would
have
been
a
charity
to
the
living
had
the
river
overwhelmed
me
and
borne
her
up
but
i
cannot
die
those
who
ought
to
have
lived
lie
dead
and
here
am
i
alive
but
you
can
t
charge
yourself
with
crimes
in
that
way
said
venn
you
may
as
well
say
that
the
parents
be
the
cause
of
a
murder
by
the
child
for
without
the
parents
the
child
would
never
have
been
begot
yes
venn
that
is
very
true
but
you
don
t
know
all
the
circumstances
if
it
had
pleased
god
to
put
an
end
to
me
it
would
have
been
a
good
thing
for
all
but
i
am
getting
used
to
the
horror
of
my
existence
they
say
that
a
time
comes
when
men
laugh
at
misery
through
long
acquaintance
with
it
surely
that
time
will
soon
come
to
me
your
aim
has
always
been
good
said
venn
why
should
you
say
such
desperate
things
no
they
are
not
desperate
they
are
only
hopeless
and
my
great
regret
is
that
for
what
i
have
done
no
man
or
law
can
punish
me
book
six
aftercourses
the
inevitable
movement
onward
the
story
of
the
deaths
of
eustacia
and
wildeve
was
told
throughout
egdon
and
far
beyond
for
many
weeks
and
months
all
the
known
incidents
of
their
love
were
enlarged
distorted
touched
up
and
modified
till
the
original
reality
bore
but
a
slight
resemblance
to
the
counterfeit
presentation
by
surrounding
tongues
yet
upon
the
whole
neither
the
man
nor
the
woman
lost
dignity
by
sudden
death
misfortune
had
struck
them
gracefully
cutting
off
their
erratic
histories
with
a
catastrophic
dash
instead
of
as
with
many
attenuating
each
life
to
an
uninteresting
meagreness
through
long
years
of
wrinkles
neglect
and
decay
on
those
most
nearly
concerned
the
effect
was
somewhat
different
strangers
who
had
heard
of
many
such
cases
now
merely
heard
of
one
more
but
immediately
where
a
blow
falls
no
previous
imaginings
amount
to
appreciable
preparation
for
it
the
very
suddenness
of
her
bereavement
dulled
to
some
extent
thomasin
s
feelings
yet
irrationally
enough
a
consciousness
that
the
husband
she
had
lost
ought
to
have
been
a
better
man
did
not
lessen
her
mourning
at
all
on
the
contrary
this
fact
seemed
at
first
to
set
off
the
dead
husband
in
his
young
wife
s
eyes
and
to
be
the
necessary
cloud
to
the
rainbow
but
the
horrors
of
the
unknown
had
passed
vague
misgivings
about
her
future
as
a
deserted
wife
were
at
an
end
the
worst
had
once
been
matter
of
trembling
conjecture
it
was
now
matter
of
reason
only
a
limited
badness
her
chief
interest
the
little
eustacia
still
remained
there
was
humility
in
her
grief
no
defiance
in
her
attitude
and
when
this
is
the
case
a
shaken
spirit
is
apt
to
be
stilled
could
thomasin
s
mournfulness
now
and
eustacia
s
serenity
during
life
have
been
reduced
to
common
measure
they
would
have
touched
the
same
mark
nearly
but
thomasin
s
former
brightness
made
shadow
of
that
which
in
a
sombre
atmosphere
was
light
itself
the
spring
came
and
calmed
her
the
summer
came
and
soothed
her
the
autumn
arrived
and
she
began
to
be
comforted
for
her
little
girl
was
strong
and
happy
growing
in
size
and
knowledge
every
day
outward
events
flattered
thomasin
not
a
little
wildeve
had
died
intestate
and
she
and
the
child
were
his
only
relatives
when
administration
had
been
granted
all
the
debts
paid
and
the
residue
of
her
husband
s
uncle
s
property
had
come
into
her
hands
it
was
found
that
the
sum
waiting
to
be
invested
for
her
own
and
the
child
s
benefit
was
little
less
than
ten
thousand
pounds
where
should
she
live
the
obvious
place
was
blooms
end
the
old
rooms
it
is
true
were
not
much
higher
than
the
between
decks
of
a
frigate
necessitating
a
sinking
in
the
floor
under
the
new
clock
case
she
brought
from
the
inn
and
the
removal
of
the
handsome
brass
knobs
on
its
head
before
there
was
height
for
it
to
stand
but
such
as
the
rooms
were
there
were
plenty
of
them
and
the
place
was
endeared
to
her
by
every
early
recollection
clym
very
gladly
admitted
her
as
a
tenant
confining
his
own
existence
to
two
rooms
at
the
top
of
the
back
staircase
where
he
lived
on
quietly
shut
off
from
thomasin
and
the
three
servants
she
had
thought
fit
to
indulge
in
now
that
she
was
a
mistress
of
money
going
his
own
ways
and
thinking
his
own
thoughts
his
sorrows
had
made
some
change
in
his
outward
appearance
and
yet
the
alteration
was
chiefly
within
it
might
have
been
said
that
he
had
a
wrinkled
mind
he
had
no
enemies
and
he
could
get
nobody
to
reproach
him
which
was
why
he
so
bitterly
reproached
himself
he
did
sometimes
think
he
had
been
ill
used
by
fortune
so
far
as
to
say
that
to
be
born
is
a
palpable
dilemma
and
that
instead
of
men
aiming
to
advance
in
life
with
glory
they
should
calculate
how
to
retreat
out
of
it
without
shame
but
that
he
and
his
had
been
sarcastically
and
pitilessly
handled
in
having
such
irons
thrust
into
their
souls
he
did
not
maintain
long
it
is
usually
so
except
with
the
sternest
of
men
human
beings
in
their
generous
endeavour
to
construct
a
hypothesis
that
shall
not
degrade
a
first
cause
have
always
hesitated
to
conceive
a
dominant
power
of
lower
moral
quality
than
their
own
and
even
while
they
sit
down
and
weep
by
the
waters
of
babylon
invent
excuses
for
the
oppression
which
prompts
their
tears
thus
though
words
of
solace
were
vainly
uttered
in
his
presence
he
found
relief
in
a
direction
of
his
own
choosing
when
left
to
himself
for
a
man
of
his
habits
the
house
and
the
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
a
year
which
he
had
inherited
from
his
mother
were
enough
to
supply
all
worldly
needs
resources
do
not
depend
upon
gross
amounts
but
upon
the
proportion
of
spendings
to
takings
he
frequently
walked
the
heath
alone
when
the
past
seized
upon
him
with
its
shadowy
hand
and
held
him
there
to
listen
to
its
tale
his
imagination
would
then
people
the
spot
with
its
ancient
inhabitants
forgotten
celtic
tribes
trod
their
tracks
about
him
and
he
could
almost
live
among
them
look
in
their
faces
and
see
them
standing
beside
the
barrows
which
swelled
around
untouched
and
perfect
as
at
the
time
of
their
erection
those
of
the
dyed
barbarians
who
had
chosen
the
cultivable
tracts
were
in
comparison
with
those
who
had
left
their
marks
here
as
writers
on
paper
beside
writers
on
parchment
their
records
had
perished
long
ago
by
the
plough
while
the
works
of
these
remained
yet
they
all
had
lived
and
died
unconscious
of
the
different
fates
awaiting
their
relics
it
reminded
him
that
unforeseen
factors
operate
in
the
evolution
of
immortality
winter
again
came
round
with
its
winds
frosts
tame
robins
and
sparkling
starlight
the
year
previous
thomasin
had
hardly
been
conscious
of
the
season
s
advance
this
year
she
laid
her
heart
open
to
external
influences
of
every
kind
the
life
of
this
sweet
cousin
her
baby
and
her
servants
came
to
clym
s
senses
only
in
the
form
of
sounds
through
a
wood
partition
as
he
sat
over
books
of
exceptionally
large
type
but
his
ear
became
at
last
so
accustomed
to
these
slight
noises
from
the
other
part
of
the
house
that
he
almost
could
witness
the
scenes
they
signified
a
faint
beat
of
half
seconds
conjured
up
thomasin
rocking
the
cradle
a
wavering
hum
meant
that
she
was
singing
the
baby
to
sleep
a
crunching
of
sand
as
between
millstones
raised
the
picture
of
humphrey
s
fairway
s
or
sam
s
heavy
feet
crossing
the
stone
floor
of
the
kitchen
a
light
boyish
step
and
a
gay
tune
in
a
high
key
betokened
a
visit
from
grandfer
cantle
a
sudden
break
off
in
the
grandfer
s
utterances
implied
the
application
to
his
lips
of
a
mug
of
small
beer
a
bustling
and
slamming
of
doors
meant
starting
to
go
to
market
for
thomasin
in
spite
of
her
added
scope
of
gentility
led
a
ludicrously
narrow
life
to
the
end
that
she
might
save
every
possible
pound
for
her
little
daughter
one
summer
day
clym
was
in
the
garden
immediately
outside
the
parlour
window
which
was
as
usual
open
he
was
looking
at
the
pot
flowers
on
the
sill
they
had
been
revived
and
restored
by
thomasin
to
the
state
in
which
his
mother
had
left
them
he
heard
a
slight
scream
from
thomasin
who
was
sitting
inside
the
room
o
how
you
frightened
me
she
said
to
someone
who
had
entered
i
thought
you
were
the
ghost
of
yourself
clym
was
curious
enough
to
advance
a
little
further
and
look
in
at
the
window
to
his
astonishment
there
stood
within
the
room
diggory
venn
no
longer
a
reddleman
but
exhibiting
the
strangely
altered
hues
of
an
ordinary
christian
countenance
white
shirt
front
light
flowered
waistcoat
blue
spotted
neckerchief
and
bottle
green
coat
nothing
in
this
appearance
was
at
all
singular
but
the
fact
of
its
great
difference
from
what
he
had
formerly
been
red
and
all
approach
to
red
was
carefully
excluded
from
every
article
of
clothes
upon
him
for
what
is
there
that
persons
just
out
of
harness
dread
so
much
as
reminders
of
the
trade
which
has
enriched
them
yeobright
went
round
to
the
door
and
entered
i
was
so
alarmed
said
thomasin
smiling
from
one
to
the
other
i
couldn
t
believe
that
he
had
got
white
of
his
own
accord
it
seemed
supernatural
i
gave
up
dealing
in
reddle
last
christmas
said
venn
it
was
a
profitable
trade
and
i
found
that
by
that
time
i
had
made
enough
to
take
the
dairy
of
fifty
cows
that
my
father
had
in
his
lifetime
i
always
thought
of
getting
to
that
place
again
if
i
changed
at
all
and
now
i
am
there
how
did
you
manage
to
become
white
diggory
thomasin
asked
i
turned
so
by
degrees
ma
am
you
look
much
better
than
ever
you
did
before
venn
appeared
confused
and
thomasin
seeing
how
inadvertently
she
had
spoken
to
a
man
who
might
possibly
have
tender
feelings
for
her
still
blushed
a
little
clym
saw
nothing
of
this
and
added
good
humouredly
what
shall
we
have
to
frighten
thomasin
s
baby
with
now
you
have
become
a
human
being
again
sit
down
diggory
said
thomasin
and
stay
to
tea
venn
moved
as
if
he
would
retire
to
the
kitchen
when
thomasin
said
with
pleasant
pertness
as
she
went
on
with
some
sewing
of
course
you
must
sit
down
here
and
where
does
your
fifty
cow
dairy
lie
mr
venn
at
stickleford
about
two
miles
to
the
right
of
alderworth
ma
am
where
the
meads
begin
i
have
thought
that
if
mr
yeobright
would
like
to
pay
me
a
visit
sometimes
he
shouldn
t
stay
away
for
want
of
asking
i
ll
not
bide
to
tea
this
afternoon
thank
ee
for
i
ve
got
something
on
hand
that
must
be
settled
tis
maypole
day
tomorrow
and
the
shadwater
folk
have
clubbed
with
a
few
of
your
neighbours
here
to
have
a
pole
just
outside
your
palings
in
the
heath
as
it
is
a
nice
green
place
venn
waved
his
elbow
towards
the
patch
in
front
of
the
house
i
have
been
talking
to
fairway
about
it
he
continued
and
i
said
to
him
that
before
we
put
up
the
pole
it
would
be
as
well
to
ask
mrs
wildeve
i
can
say
nothing
against
it
she
answered
our
property
does
not
reach
an
inch
further
than
the
white
palings
but
you
might
not
like
to
see
a
lot
of
folk
going
crazy
round
a
stick
under
your
very
nose
i
shall
have
no
objection
at
all
venn
soon
after
went
away
and
in
the
evening
yeobright
strolled
as
far
as
fairway
s
cottage
it
was
a
lovely
may
sunset
and
the
birch
trees
which
grew
on
this
margin
of
the
vast
egdon
wilderness
had
put
on
their
new
leaves
delicate
as
butterflies
wings
and
diaphanous
as
amber
beside
fairway
s
dwelling
was
an
open
space
recessed
from
the
road
and
here
were
now
collected
all
the
young
people
from
within
a
radius
of
a
couple
of
miles
the
pole
lay
with
one
end
supported
on
a
trestle
and
women
were
engaged
in
wreathing
it
from
the
top
downwards
with
wild
flowers
the
instincts
of
merry
england
lingered
on
here
with
exceptional
vitality
and
the
symbolic
customs
which
tradition
has
attached
to
each
season
of
the
year
were
yet
a
reality
on
egdon
indeed
the
impulses
of
all
such
outlandish
hamlets
are
pagan
still
in
these
spots
homage
to
nature
self
adoration
frantic
gaieties
fragments
of
teutonic
rites
to
divinities
whose
names
are
forgotten
seem
in
some
way
or
other
to
have
survived
mediaeval
doctrine
yeobright
did
not
interrupt
the
preparations
and
went
home
again
the
next
morning
when
thomasin
withdrew
the
curtains
of
her
bedroom
window
there
stood
the
maypole
in
the
middle
of
the
green
its
top
cutting
into
the
sky
it
had
sprung
up
in
the
night
or
rather
early
morning
like
jack
s
bean
stalk
she
opened
the
casement
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
garlands
and
posies
that
adorned
it
the
sweet
perfume
of
the
flowers
had
already
spread
into
the
surrounding
air
which
being
free
from
every
taint
conducted
to
her
lips
a
full
measure
of
the
fragrance
received
from
the
spire
of
blossom
in
its
midst
at
the
top
of
the
pole
were
crossed
hoops
decked
with
small
flowers
beneath
these
came
a
milk
white
zone
of
maybloom
then
a
zone
of
bluebells
then
of
cowslips
then
of
lilacs
then
of
ragged
robins
daffodils
and
so
on
till
the
lowest
stage
was
reached
thomasin
noticed
all
these
and
was
delighted
that
the
may
revel
was
to
be
so
near
when
afternoon
came
people
began
to
gather
on
the
green
and
yeobright
was
interested
enough
to
look
out
upon
them
from
the
open
window
of
his
room
soon
after
this
thomasin
walked
out
from
the
door
immediately
below
and
turned
her
eyes
up
to
her
cousin
s
face
she
was
dressed
more
gaily
than
yeobright
had
ever
seen
her
dressed
since
the
time
of
wildeve
s
death
eighteen
months
before
since
the
day
of
her
marriage
even
she
had
not
exhibited
herself
to
such
advantage
how
pretty
you
look
today
thomasin
he
said
is
it
because
of
the
maypole
not
altogether
and
then
she
blushed
and
dropped
her
eyes
which
he
did
not
specially
observe
though
her
manner
seemed
to
him
to
be
rather
peculiar
considering
that
she
was
only
addressing
himself
could
it
be
possible
that
she
had
put
on
her
summer
clothes
to
please
him
he
recalled
her
conduct
towards
him
throughout
the
last
few
weeks
when
they
had
often
been
working
together
in
the
garden
just
as
they
had
formerly
done
when
they
were
boy
and
girl
under
his
mother
s
eye
what
if
her
interest
in
him
were
not
so
entirely
that
of
a
relative
as
it
had
formerly
been
to
yeobright
any
possibility
of
this
sort
was
a
serious
matter
and
he
almost
felt
troubled
at
the
thought
of
it
every
pulse
of
loverlike
feeling
which
had
not
been
stilled
during
eustacia
s
lifetime
had
gone
into
the
grave
with
her
his
passion
for
her
had
occurred
too
far
on
in
his
manhood
to
leave
fuel
enough
on
hand
for
another
fire
of
that
sort
as
may
happen
with
more
boyish
loves
even
supposing
him
capable
of
loving
again
that
love
would
be
a
plant
of
slow
and
laboured
growth
and
in
the
end
only
small
and
sickly
like
an
autumn
hatched
bird
he
was
so
distressed
by
this
new
complexity
that
when
the
enthusiastic
brass
band
arrived
and
struck
up
which
it
did
about
five
o
clock
with
apparently
wind
enough
among
its
members
to
blow
down
his
house
he
withdrew
from
his
rooms
by
the
back
door
went
down
the
garden
through
the
gate
in
the
hedge
and
away
out
of
sight
he
could
not
bear
to
remain
in
the
presence
of
enjoyment
today
though
he
had
tried
hard
nothing
was
seen
of
him
for
four
hours
when
he
came
back
by
the
same
path
it
was
dusk
and
the
dews
were
coating
every
green
thing
the
boisterous
music
had
ceased
but
entering
the
premises
as
he
did
from
behind
he
could
not
see
if
the
may
party
had
all
gone
till
he
had
passed
through
thomasin
s
division
of
the
house
to
the
front
door
thomasin
was
standing
within
the
porch
alone
she
looked
at
him
reproachfully
you
went
away
just
when
it
began
clym
she
said
yes
i
felt
i
could
not
join
in
you
went
out
with
them
of
course
no
i
did
not
you
appeared
to
be
dressed
on
purpose
yes
but
i
could
not
go
out
alone
so
many
people
were
there
one
is
there
now
yeobright
strained
his
eyes
across
the
dark
green
patch
beyond
the
paling
and
near
the
black
form
of
the
maypole
he
discerned
a
shadowy
figure
sauntering
idly
up
and
down
who
is
it
he
said
mr
venn
said
thomasin
you
might
have
asked
him
to
come
in
i
think
tamsie
he
has
been
very
kind
to
you
first
and
last
i
will
now
she
said
and
acting
on
the
impulse
went
through
the
wicket
to
where
venn
stood
under
the
maypole
it
is
mr
venn
i
think
she
inquired
venn
started
as
if
he
had
not
seen
her
artful
man
that
he
was
and
said
yes
will
you
come
in
i
am
afraid
that
i
i
have
seen
you
dancing
this
evening
and
you
had
the
very
best
of
the
girls
for
your
partners
is
it
that
you
won
t
come
in
because
you
wish
to
stand
here
and
think
over
the
past
hours
of
enjoyment
well
that
s
partly
it
said
mr
venn
with
ostentatious
sentiment
but
the
main
reason
why
i
am
biding
here
like
this
is
that
i
want
to
wait
till
the
moon
rises
to
see
how
pretty
the
maypole
looks
in
the
moonlight
no
to
look
for
a
glove
that
was
dropped
by
one
of
the
maidens
thomasin
was
speechless
with
surprise
that
a
man
who
had
to
walk
some
four
or
five
miles
to
his
home
should
wait
here
for
such
a
reason
pointed
to
only
one
conclusion
the
man
must
be
amazingly
interested
in
that
glove
s
owner
were
you
dancing
with
her
diggory
she
asked
in
a
voice
which
revealed
that
he
had
made
himself
considerably
more
interesting
to
her
by
this
disclosure
no
he
sighed
and
you
will
not
come
in
then
not
tonight
thank
you
ma
am
shall
i
lend
you
a
lantern
to
look
for
the
young
person
s
glove
mr
venn
o
no
it
is
not
necessary
mrs
wildeve
thank
you
the
moon
will
rise
in
a
few
minutes
thomasin
went
back
to
the
porch
is
he
coming
in
said
clym
who
had
been
waiting
where
she
had
left
him
he
would
rather
not
tonight
she
said
and
then
passed
by
him
into
the
house
whereupon
clym
too
retired
to
his
own
rooms
when
clym
was
gone
thomasin
crept
upstairs
in
the
dark
and
just
listening
by
the
cot
to
assure
herself
that
the
child
was
asleep
she
went
to
the
window
gently
lifted
the
corner
of
the
white
curtain
and
looked
out
venn
was
still
there
she
watched
the
growth
of
the
faint
radiance
appearing
in
the
sky
by
the
eastern
hill
till
presently
the
edge
of
the
moon
burst
upwards
and
flooded
the
valley
with
light
diggory
s
form
was
now
distinct
on
the
green
he
was
moving
about
in
a
bowed
attitude
evidently
scanning
the
grass
for
the
precious
missing
article
walking
in
zigzags
right
and
left
till
he
should
have
passed
over
every
foot
of
the
ground
how
very
ridiculous
thomasin
murmured
to
herself
in
a
tone
which
was
intended
to
be
satirical
to
think
that
a
man
should
be
so
silly
as
to
go
mooning
about
like
that
for
a
girl
s
glove
a
respectable
dairyman
too
and
a
man
of
money
as
he
is
now
what
a
pity
at
last
venn
appeared
to
find
it
whereupon
he
stood
up
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
then
placing
it
in
his
breastpocket
the
nearest
receptacle
to
a
man
s
heart
permitted
by
modern
raiment
he
ascended
the
valley
in
a
mathematically
direct
line
towards
his
distant
home
in
the
meadows
thomasin
walks
in
a
green
place
by
the
roman
road
clym
saw
little
of
thomasin
for
several
days
after
this
and
when
they
met
she
was
more
silent
than
usual
at
length
he
asked
her
what
she
was
thinking
of
so
intently
i
am
thoroughly
perplexed
she
said
candidly
i
cannot
for
my
life
think
who
it
is
that
diggory
venn
is
so
much
in
love
with
none
of
the
girls
at
the
maypole
were
good
enough
for
him
and
yet
she
must
have
been
there
clym
tried
to
imagine
venn
s
choice
for
a
moment
but
ceasing
to
be
interested
in
the
question
he
went
on
again
with
his
gardening
no
clearing
up
of
the
mystery
was
granted
her
for
some
time
but
one
afternoon
thomasin
was
upstairs
getting
ready
for
a
walk
when
she
had
occasion
to
come
to
the
landing
and
call
rachel
rachel
was
a
girl
about
thirteen
who
carried
the
baby
out
for
airings
and
she
came
upstairs
at
the
call
have
you
seen
one
of
my
last
new
gloves
about
the
house
rachel
inquired
thomasin
it
is
the
fellow
to
this
one
rachel
did
not
reply
why
don
t
you
answer
said
her
mistress
i
think
it
is
lost
ma
am
lost
who
lost
it
i
have
never
worn
them
but
once
rachel
appeared
as
one
dreadfully
troubled
and
at
last
began
to
cry
please
ma
am
on
the
day
of
the
maypole
i
had
none
to
wear
and
i
seed
yours
on
the
table
and
i
thought
i
would
borrow
em
i
did
not
mean
to
hurt
em
at
all
but
one
of
them
got
lost
somebody
gave
me
some
money
to
buy
another
pair
for
you
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
go
anywhere
to
get
em
who
s
somebody
mr
venn
did
he
know
it
was
my
glove
yes
i
told
him
thomasin
was
so
surprised
by
the
explanation
that
she
quite
forgot
to
lecture
the
girl
who
glided
silently
away
thomasin
did
not
move
further
than
to
turn
her
eyes
upon
the
grass
plat
where
the
maypole
had
stood
she
remained
thinking
then
said
to
herself
that
she
would
not
go
out
that
afternoon
but
would
work
hard
at
the
baby
s
unfinished
lovely
plaid
frock
cut
on
the
cross
in
the
newest
fashion
how
she
managed
to
work
hard
and
yet
do
no
more
than
she
had
done
at
the
end
of
two
hours
would
have
been
a
mystery
to
anyone
not
aware
that
the
recent
incident
was
of
a
kind
likely
to
divert
her
industry
from
a
manual
to
a
mental
channel
next
day
she
went
her
ways
as
usual
and
continued
her
custom
of
walking
in
the
heath
with
no
other
companion
than
little
eustacia
now
of
the
age
when
it
is
a
matter
of
doubt
with
such
characters
whether
they
are
intended
to
walk
through
the
world
on
their
hands
or
on
their
feet
so
that
they
get
into
painful
complications
by
trying
both
it
was
very
pleasant
to
thomasin
when
she
had
carried
the
child
to
some
lonely
place
to
give
her
a
little
private
practice
on
the
green
turf
and
shepherd
s
thyme
which
formed
a
soft
mat
to
fall
headlong
upon
them
when
equilibrium
was
lost
once
when
engaged
in
this
system
of
training
and
stooping
to
remove
bits
of
stick
fern
stalks
and
other
such
fragments
from
the
child
s
path
that
the
journey
might
not
be
brought
to
an
untimely
end
by
some
insuperable
barrier
a
quarter
of
an
inch
high
she
was
alarmed
by
discovering
that
a
man
on
horseback
was
almost
close
beside
her
the
soft
natural
carpet
having
muffled
the
horse
s
tread
the
rider
who
was
venn
waved
his
hat
in
the
air
and
bowed
gallantly
diggory
give
me
my
glove
said
thomasin
whose
manner
it
was
under
any
circumstances
to
plunge
into
the
midst
of
a
subject
which
engrossed
her
venn
immediately
dismounted
put
his
hand
in
his
breastpocket
and
handed
the
glove
thank
you
it
was
very
good
of
you
to
take
care
of
it
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
say
so
o
no
i
was
quite
glad
to
find
you
had
it
everybody
gets
so
indifferent
that
i
was
surprised
to
know
you
thought
of
me
if
you
had
remembered
what
i
was
once
you
wouldn
t
have
been
surprised
ah
no
she
said
quickly
but
men
of
your
character
are
mostly
so
independent
what
is
my
character
he
asked
i
don
t
exactly
know
said
thomasin
simply
except
it
is
to
cover
up
your
feelings
under
a
practical
manner
and
only
to
show
them
when
you
are
alone
ah
how
do
you
know
that
said
venn
strategically
because
said
she
stopping
to
put
the
little
girl
who
had
managed
to
get
herself
upside
down
right
end
up
again
because
i
do
you
mustn
t
judge
by
folks
in
general
said
venn
still
i
don
t
know
much
what
feelings
are
nowadays
i
have
got
so
mixed
up
with
business
of
one
sort
and
t
other
that
my
soft
sentiments
are
gone
off
in
vapour
like
yes
i
am
given
up
body
and
soul
to
the
making
of
money
money
is
all
my
dream
o
diggory
how
wicked
said
thomasin
reproachfully
and
looking
at
him
in
exact
balance
between
taking
his
words
seriously
and
judging
them
as
said
to
tease
her
yes
tis
rather
a
rum
course
said
venn
in
the
bland
tone
of
one
comfortably
resigned
to
sins
he
could
no
longer
overcome
you
who
used
to
be
so
nice
well
that
s
an
argument
i
rather
like
because
what
a
man
has
once
been
he
may
be
again
thomasin
blushed
except
that
it
is
rather
harder
now
venn
continued
why
she
asked
because
you
be
richer
than
you
were
at
that
time
o
no
not
much
i
have
made
it
nearly
all
over
to
the
baby
as
it
was
my
duty
to
do
except
just
enough
to
live
on
i
am
rather
glad
of
that
said
venn
softly
and
regarding
her
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
for
it
makes
it
easier
for
us
to
be
friendly
thomasin
blushed
again
and
when
a
few
more
words
had
been
said
of
a
not
unpleasing
kind
venn
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
on
this
conversation
had
passed
in
a
hollow
of
the
heath
near
the
old
roman
road
a
place
much
frequented
by
thomasin
and
it
might
have
been
observed
that
she
did
not
in
future
walk
that
way
less
often
from
having
met
venn
there
now
whether
or
not
venn
abstained
from
riding
thither
because
he
had
met
thomasin
in
the
same
place
might
easily
have
been
guessed
from
her
proceedings
about
two
months
later
in
the
same
year
the
serious
discourse
of
clym
with
his
cousin
throughout
this
period
yeobright
had
more
or
less
pondered
on
his
duty
to
his
cousin
thomasin
he
could
not
help
feeling
that
it
would
be
a
pitiful
waste
of
sweet
material
if
the
tender
natured
thing
should
be
doomed
from
this
early
stage
of
her
life
onwards
to
dribble
away
her
winsome
qualities
on
lonely
gorse
and
fern
but
he
felt
this
as
an
economist
merely
and
not
as
a
lover
his
passion
for
eustacia
had
been
a
sort
of
conserve
of
his
whole
life
and
he
had
nothing
more
of
that
supreme
quality
left
to
bestow
so
far
the
obvious
thing
was
not
to
entertain
any
idea
of
marriage
with
thomasin
even
to
oblige
her
but
this
was
not
all
years
ago
there
had
been
in
his
mother
s
mind
a
great
fancy
about
thomasin
and
himself
it
had
not
positively
amounted
to
a
desire
but
it
had
always
been
a
favourite
dream
that
they
should
be
man
and
wife
in
good
time
if
the
happiness
of
neither
were
endangered
thereby
was
the
fancy
in
question
so
that
what
course
save
one
was
there
now
left
for
any
son
who
reverenced
his
mother
s
memory
as
yeobright
did
it
is
an
unfortunate
fact
that
any
particular
whim
of
parents
which
might
have
been
dispersed
by
half
an
hour
s
conversation
during
their
lives
becomes
sublimated
by
their
deaths
into
a
fiat
the
most
absolute
with
such
results
to
conscientious
children
as
those
parents
had
they
lived
would
have
been
the
first
to
decry
had
only
yeobright
s
own
future
been
involved
he
would
have
proposed
to
thomasin
with
a
ready
heart
he
had
nothing
to
lose
by
carrying
out
a
dead
mother
s
hope
but
he
dreaded
to
contemplate
thomasin
wedded
to
the
mere
corpse
of
a
lover
that
he
now
felt
himself
to
be
he
had
but
three
activities
alive
in
him
one
was
his
almost
daily
walk
to
the
little
graveyard
wherein
his
mother
lay
another
his
just
as
frequent
visits
by
night
to
the
more
distant
enclosure
which
numbered
his
eustacia
among
its
dead
the
third
was
self
preparation
for
a
vocation
which
alone
seemed
likely
to
satisfy
his
cravings
that
of
an
itinerant
preacher
of
the
eleventh
commandment
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
thomasin
would
be
cheered
by
a
husband
with
such
tendencies
as
these
yet
he
resolved
to
ask
her
and
let
her
decide
for
herself
it
was
even
with
a
pleasant
sense
of
doing
his
duty
that
he
went
downstairs
to
her
one
evening
for
this
purpose
when
the
sun
was
printing
on
the
valley
the
same
long
shadow
of
the
housetop
that
he
had
seen
lying
there
times
out
of
number
while
his
mother
lived
thomasin
was
not
in
her
room
and
he
found
her
in
the
front
garden
i
have
long
been
wanting
thomasin
he
began
to
say
something
about
a
matter
that
concerns
both
our
futures
and
you
are
going
to
say
it
now
she
remarked
quickly
colouring
as
she
met
his
gaze
do
stop
a
minute
clym
and
let
me
speak
first
for
oddly
enough
i
have
been
wanting
to
say
something
to
you
by
all
means
say
on
tamsie
i
suppose
nobody
can
overhear
us
she
went
on
casting
her
eyes
around
and
lowering
her
voice
well
first
you
will
promise
me
this
that
you
won
t
be
angry
and
call
me
anything
harsh
if
you
disagree
with
what
i
propose
yeobright
promised
and
she
continued
what
i
want
is
your
advice
for
you
are
my
relation
i
mean
a
sort
of
guardian
to
me
aren
t
you
clym
well
yes
i
suppose
i
am
a
sort
of
guardian
in
fact
i
am
of
course
he
said
altogether
perplexed
as
to
her
drift
i
am
thinking
of
marrying
she
then
observed
blandly
but
i
shall
not
marry
unless
you
assure
me
that
you
approve
of
such
a
step
why
don
t
you
speak
i
was
taken
rather
by
surprise
but
nevertheless
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
such
news
i
shall
approve
of
course
dear
tamsie
who
can
it
be
i
am
quite
at
a
loss
to
guess
no
i
am
not
tis
the
old
doctor
not
that
i
mean
to
call
him
old
for
he
is
not
very
old
after
all
ah
i
noticed
when
he
attended
you
last
time
no
no
she
said
hastily
tis
mr
venn
clym
s
face
suddenly
became
grave
there
now
you
don
t
like
him
and
i
wish
i
hadn
t
mentioned
him
she
exclaimed
almost
petulantly
and
i
shouldn
t
have
done
it
either
only
he
keeps
on
bothering
me
so
till
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
clym
looked
at
the
heath
i
like
venn
well
enough
he
answered
at
last
he
is
a
very
honest
and
at
the
same
time
astute
man
he
is
clever
too
as
is
proved
by
his
having
got
you
to
favour
him
but
really
thomasin
he
is
not
quite
gentleman
enough
for
me
that
is
just
what
i
feel
i
am
sorry
now
that
i
asked
you
and
i
won
t
think
any
more
of
him
at
the
same
time
i
must
marry
him
if
i
marry
anybody
that
i
will
say
i
don
t
see
that
said
clym
carefully
concealing
every
clue
to
his
own
interrupted
intention
which
she
plainly
had
not
guessed
you
might
marry
a
professional
man
or
somebody
of
that
sort
by
going
into
the
town
to
live
and
forming
acquaintances
there
i
am
not
fit
for
town
life
so
very
rural
and
silly
as
i
always
have
been
do
not
you
yourself
notice
my
countrified
ways
well
when
i
came
home
from
paris
i
did
a
little
but
i
don
t
now
that
s
because
you
have
got
countrified
too
o
i
couldn
t
live
in
a
street
for
the
world
egdon
is
a
ridiculous
old
place
but
i
have
got
used
to
it
and
i
couldn
t
be
happy
anywhere
else
at
all
neither
could
i
said
clym
then
how
could
you
say
that
i
should
marry
some
town
man
i
am
sure
say
what
you
will
that
i
must
marry
diggory
if
i
marry
at
all
he
has
been
kinder
to
me
than
anybody
else
and
has
helped
me
in
many
ways
that
i
don
t
know
of
thomasin
almost
pouted
now
yes
he
has
said
clym
in
a
neutral
tone
well
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
i
could
say
marry
him
but
i
cannot
forget
what
my
mother
thought
on
that
matter
and
it
goes
rather
against
me
not
to
respect
her
opinion
there
is
too
much
reason
why
we
should
do
the
little
we
can
to
respect
it
now
very
well
then
sighed
thomasin
i
will
say
no
more
but
you
are
not
bound
to
obey
my
wishes
i
merely
say
what
i
think
o
no
i
don
t
want
to
be
rebellious
in
that
way
she
said
sadly
i
had
no
business
to
think
of
him
i
ought
to
have
thought
of
my
family
what
dreadfully
bad
impulses
there
are
in
me
her
lips
trembled
and
she
turned
away
to
hide
a
tear
clym
though
vexed
at
what
seemed
her
unaccountable
taste
was
in
a
measure
relieved
to
find
that
at
any
rate
the
marriage
question
in
relation
to
himself
was
shelved
through
several
succeeding
days
he
saw
her
at
different
times
from
the
window
of
his
room
moping
disconsolately
about
the
garden
he
was
half
angry
with
her
for
choosing
venn
then
he
was
grieved
at
having
put
himself
in
the
way
of
venn
s
happiness
who
was
after
all
as
honest
and
persevering
a
young
fellow
as
any
on
egdon
since
he
had
turned
over
a
new
leaf
in
short
clym
did
not
know
what
to
do
when
next
they
met
she
said
abruptly
he
is
much
more
respectable
now
than
he
was
then
who
o
yes
diggory
venn
aunt
only
objected
because
he
was
a
reddleman
well
thomasin
perhaps
i
don
t
know
all
the
particulars
of
my
mother
s
wish
so
you
had
better
use
your
own
discretion
you
will
always
feel
that
i
slighted
your
mother
s
memory
no
i
will
not
i
shall
think
you
are
convinced
that
had
she
seen
diggory
in
his
present
position
she
would
have
considered
him
a
fitting
husband
for
you
now
that
s
my
real
feeling
don
t
consult
me
any
more
but
do
as
you
like
thomasin
i
shall
be
content
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
thomasin
was
convinced
for
a
few
days
after
this
when
clym
strayed
into
a
part
of
the
heath
that
he
had
not
lately
visited
humphrey
who
was
at
work
there
said
to
him
i
am
glad
to
see
that
mrs
wildeve
and
venn
have
made
it
up
again
seemingly
have
they
said
clym
abstractedly
yes
and
he
do
contrive
to
stumble
upon
her
whenever
she
walks
out
on
fine
days
with
the
chiel
but
mr
yeobright
i
can
t
help
feeling
that
your
cousin
ought
to
have
married
you
tis
a
pity
to
make
two
chimleycorners
where
there
need
be
only
one
you
could
get
her
away
from
him
now
tis
my
belief
if
you
were
only
to
set
about
it
how
can
i
have
the
conscience
to
marry
after
having
driven
two
women
to
their
deaths
don
t
think
such
a
thing
humphrey
after
my
experience
i
should
consider
it
too
much
of
a
burlesque
to
go
to
church
and
take
a
wife
in
the
words
of
job
i
have
made
a
covenant
with
mine
eyes
when
then
should
i
think
upon
a
maid
no
mr
clym
don
t
fancy
that
about
driving
two
women
to
their
deaths
you
shouldn
t
say
it
well
we
ll
leave
that
out
said
yeobright
but
anyhow
god
has
set
a
mark
upon
me
which
wouldn
t
look
well
in
a
love
making
scene
i
have
two
ideas
in
my
head
and
no
others
i
am
going
to
keep
a
night
school
and
i
am
going
to
turn
preacher
what
have
you
got
to
say
to
that
humphrey
i
ll
come
and
hear
ee
with
all
my
heart
thanks
tis
all
i
wish
as
clym
descended
into
the
valley
thomasin
came
down
by
the
other
path
and
met
him
at
the
gate
what
do
you
think
i
have
to
tell
you
clym
she
said
looking
archly
over
her
shoulder
at
him
i
can
guess
he
replied
she
scrutinized
his
face
yes
you
guess
right
it
is
going
to
be
after
all
he
thinks
i
may
as
well
make
up
my
mind
and
i
have
got
to
think
so
too
it
is
to
be
on
the
twenty
fifth
of
next
month
if
you
don
t
object
do
what
you
think
right
dear
i
am
only
too
glad
that
you
see
your
way
clear
to
happiness
again
my
sex
owes
you
every
amends
for
the
treatment
you
received
in
days
gone
by
the
writer
may
state
here
that
the
original
conception
of
the
story
did
not
design
a
marriage
between
thomasin
and
venn
he
was
to
have
retained
his
isolated
and
weird
character
to
the
last
and
to
have
disappeared
mysteriously
from
the
heath
nobody
knowing
whither
thomasin
remaining
a
widow
but
certain
circumstances
of
serial
publication
led
to
a
change
of
intent
readers
can
therefore
choose
between
the
endings
and
those
with
an
austere
artistic
code
can
assume
the
more
consistent
conclusion
to
be
the
true
one
cheerfulness
again
asserts
itself
at
blooms
end
and
clym
finds
his
vocation
anybody
who
had
passed
through
blooms
end
about
eleven
o
clock
on
the
morning
fixed
for
the
wedding
would
have
found
that
while
yeobright
s
house
was
comparatively
quiet
sounds
denoting
great
activity
came
from
the
dwelling
of
his
nearest
neighbour
timothy
fairway
it
was
chiefly
a
noise
of
feet
briskly
crunching
hither
and
thither
over
the
sanded
floor
within
one
man
only
was
visible
outside
and
he
seemed
to
be
later
at
an
appointment
than
he
had
intended
to
be
for
he
hastened
up
to
the
door
lifted
the
latch
and
walked
in
without
ceremony
the
scene
within
was
not
quite
the
customary
one
standing
about
the
room
was
the
little
knot
of
men
who
formed
the
chief
part
of
the
egdon
coterie
there
being
present
fairway
himself
grandfer
cantle
humphrey
christian
and
one
or
two
turf
cutters
it
was
a
warm
day
and
the
men
were
as
a
matter
of
course
in
their
shirtsleeves
except
christian
who
had
always
a
nervous
fear
of
parting
with
a
scrap
of
his
clothing
when
in
anybody
s
house
but
his
own
across
the
stout
oak
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
thrown
a
mass
of
striped
linen
which
grandfer
cantle
held
down
on
one
side
and
humphrey
on
the
other
while
fairway
rubbed
its
surface
with
a
yellow
lump
his
face
being
damp
and
creased
with
the
effort
of
the
labour
waxing
a
bed
tick
souls
said
the
newcomer
yes
sam
said
grandfer
cantle
as
a
man
too
busy
to
waste
words
shall
i
stretch
this
corner
a
shade
tighter
timothy
fairway
replied
and
the
waxing
went
on
with
unabated
vigour
tis
going
to
be
a
good
bed
by
the
look
o
t
continued
sam
after
an
interval
of
silence
who
may
it
be
for
tis
a
present
for
the
new
folks
that
s
going
to
set
up
housekeeping
said
christian
who
stood
helpless
and
overcome
by
the
majesty
of
the
proceedings
ah
to
be
sure
and
a
valuable
one
a
b
lieve
beds
be
dear
to
fokes
that
don
t
keep
geese
bain
t
they
mister
fairway
said
christian
as
to
an
omniscient
being
yes
said
the
furze
dealer
standing
up
giving
his
forehead
a
thorough
mopping
and
handing
the
beeswax
to
humphrey
who
succeeded
at
the
rubbing
forthwith
not
that
this
couple
be
in
want
of
one
but
twas
well
to
show
em
a
bit
of
friendliness
at
this
great
racketing
vagary
of
their
lives
i
set
up
both
my
own
daughters
in
one
when
they
was
married
and
there
have
been
feathers
enough
for
another
in
the
house
the
last
twelve
months
now
then
neighbours
i
think
we
have
laid
on
enough
wax
grandfer
cantle
you
turn
the
tick
the
right
way
outwards
and
then
i
ll
begin
to
shake
in
the
feathers
when
the
bed
was
in
proper
trim
fairway
and
christian
brought
forward
vast
paper
bags
stuffed
to
the
full
but
light
as
balloons
and
began
to
turn
the
contents
of
each
into
the
receptacle
just
prepared
as
bag
after
bag
was
emptied
airy
tufts
of
down
and
feathers
floated
about
the
room
in
increasing
quantity
till
through
a
mishap
of
christian
s
who
shook
the
contents
of
one
bag
outside
the
tick
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
became
dense
with
gigantic
flakes
which
descended
upon
the
workers
like
a
windless
snowstorm
i
never
saw
such
a
clumsy
chap
as
you
christian
said
grandfer
cantle
severely
you
might
have
been
the
son
of
a
man
that
s
never
been
outside
blooms
end
in
his
life
for
all
the
wit
you
have
really
all
the
soldiering
and
smartness
in
the
world
in
the
father
seems
to
count
for
nothing
in
forming
the
nater
of
the
son
as
far
as
that
chief
christian
is
concerned
i
might
as
well
have
stayed
at
home
and
seed
nothing
like
all
the
rest
of
ye
here
though
as
far
as
myself
is
concerned
a
dashing
spirit
has
counted
for
sommat
to
be
sure
don
t
ye
let
me
down
so
father
i
feel
no
bigger
than
a
ninepin
after
it
i
ve
made
but
a
bruckle
hit
i
m
afeard
come
come
never
pitch
yerself
in
such
a
low
key
as
that
christian
you
should
try
more
said
fairway
yes
you
should
try
more
echoed
the
grandfer
with
insistence
as
if
he
had
been
the
first
to
make
the
suggestion
in
common
conscience
every
man
ought
either
to
marry
or
go
for
a
soldier
tis
a
scandal
to
the
nation
to
do
neither
one
nor
t
other
i
did
both
thank
god
neither
to
raise
men
nor
to
lay
em
low
that
shows
a
poor
do
nothing
spirit
indeed
i
never
had
the
nerve
to
stand
fire
faltered
christian
but
as
to
marrying
i
own
i
ve
asked
here
and
there
though
without
much
fruit
from
it
yes
there
s
some
house
or
other
that
might
have
had
a
man
for
a
master
such
as
he
is
that
s
now
ruled
by
a
woman
alone
still
it
might
have
been
awkward
if
i
had
found
her
for
d
ye
see
neighbours
there
d
have
been
nobody
left
at
home
to
keep
down
father
s
spirits
to
the
decent
pitch
that
becomes
a
old
man
and
you
ve
your
work
cut
out
to
do
that
my
son
said
grandfer
cantle
smartly
i
wish
that
the
dread
of
infirmities
was
not
so
strong
in
me
i
d
start
the
very
first
thing
tomorrow
to
see
the
world
over
again
but
seventy
one
though
nothing
at

a
high
figure
for
a
rover
ay
seventy
one
last
candlemasday
gad
i
d
sooner

in
guineas
than
in

and
the
old
man
sighed
don
t
you

mournful
grandfer
said
fairway
empt
some
more
feathers
into
the
bed
tick
and
keep
up
yer
heart
though
rather
lean
in
the
stalks
you
be
a
green
leaved
old
man
still
there
s
time
enough
left
to
ye
yet
to
fill
whole
chronicles
begad
i
ll
go
to
em
timothy
to
the
married
pair
said
granfer
cantle
in
an
encouraged
voice
and
starting
round
briskly
i
ll
go
to
em
tonight
and
sing
a
wedding
song
hey
tis
like
me
to
do
so
you
know
and
they
d
see
it
as
such
my
down
in
cupid
s
gardens
was
well
liked
in
four
still
i
ve
got
others
as
good
and
even
better
what
do
you
say
to
my
she
cal
led
to
her
love
from
the
lat
tice
a
bove
o
come
in
from
the
fog
gy
fog
gy
dew
twould
please
em
well
at
such
a
time
really
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
haven
t
turned
my
tongue
in
my
head
to
the
shape
of
a
real
good
song
since
old
midsummer
night
when
we
had
the
barley
mow
at
the
woman
and
tis
a
pity
to
neglect
your
strong
point
where
there
s
few
that
have
the
compass
for
such
things
so
tis
so
tis
said
fairway
now
gie
the
bed
a
shake
down
we
ve
put
in
seventy
pounds
of
best
feathers
and
i
think
that
s
as
many
as
the
tick
will
fairly
hold
a
bit
and
a
drap
wouldn
t
be
amiss
now
i
reckon
christian
maul
down
the
victuals
from
corner
cupboard
if
canst
reach
man
and
i
ll
draw
a
drap
o
sommat
to
wet
it
with
they
sat
down
to
a
lunch
in
the
midst
of
their
work
feathers
around
above
and
below
them
the
original
owners
of
which
occasionally
came
to
the
open
door
and
cackled
begrudgingly
at
sight
of
such
a
quantity
of
their
old
clothes
upon
my
soul
i
shall
be
chokt
said
fairway
when
having
extracted
a
feather
from
his
mouth
he
found
several
others
floating
on
the
mug
as
it
was
handed
round
i
ve
swallered
several
and
one
had
a
tolerable
quill
said
sam
placidly
from
the
corner
hullo
what
s
that
wheels
i
hear
coming
grandfer
cantle
exclaimed
jumping
up
and
hastening
to
the
door
why
tis
they
back
again
i
didn
t
expect
em
yet
this
half
hour
to
be
sure
how
quick
marrying
can
be
done
when
you
are
in
the
mind
for
t
o
yes
it
can
soon
be
done
said
fairway
as
if
something
should
be
added
to
make
the
statement
complete
he
arose
and
followed
the
grandfer
and
the
rest
also
went
to
the
door
in
a
moment
an
open
fly
was
driven
past
in
which
sat
venn
and
mrs
venn
yeobright
and
a
grand
relative
of
venn
s
who
had
come
from
budmouth
for
the
occasion
the
fly
had
been
hired
at
the
nearest
town
regardless
of
distance
and
cost
there
being
nothing
on
egdon
heath
in
venn
s
opinion
dignified
enough
for
such
an
event
when
such
a
woman
as
thomasin
was
the
bride
and
the
church
was
too
remote
for
a
walking
bridal
party
as
the
fly
passed
the
group
which
had
run
out
from
the
homestead
they
shouted
hurrah
and
waved
their
hands
feathers
and
down
floating
from
their
hair
their
sleeves
and
the
folds
of
their
garments
at
every
motion
and
grandfer
cantle
s
seals
dancing
merrily
in
the
sunlight
as
he
twirled
himself
about
the
driver
of
the
fly
turned
a
supercilious
gaze
upon
them
he
even
treated
the
wedded
pair
themselves
with
something
like
condescension
for
in
what
other
state
than
heathen
could
people
rich
or
poor
exist
who
were
doomed
to
abide
in
such
a
world
s
end
as
egdon
thomasin
showed
no
such
superiority
to
the
group
at
the
door
fluttering
her
hand
as
quickly
as
a
bird
s
wing
towards
them
and
asking
diggory
with
tears
in
her
eyes
if
they
ought
not
to
alight
and
speak
to
these
kind
neighbours
venn
however
suggested
that
as
they
were
all
coming
to
the
house
in
the
evening
this
was
hardly
necessary
after
this
excitement
the
saluting
party
returned
to
their
occupation
and
the
stuffing
and
sewing
were
soon
afterwards
finished
when
fairway
harnessed
a
horse
wrapped
up
the
cumbrous
present
and
drove
off
with
it
in
the
cart
to
venn
s
house
at
stickleford
yeobright
having
filled
the
office
at
the
wedding
service
which
naturally
fell
to
his
hands
and
afterwards
returned
to
the
house
with
the
husband
and
wife
was
indisposed
to
take
part
in
the
feasting
and
dancing
that
wound
up
the
evening
thomasin
was
disappointed
i
wish
i
could
be
there
without
dashing
your
spirits
he
said
but
i
might
be
too
much
like
the
skull
at
the
banquet
no
no
well
dear
apart
from
that
if
you
would
excuse
me
i
should
be
glad
i
know
it
seems
unkind
but
dear
thomasin
i
fear
i
should
not
be
happy
in
the
company
there
that
s
the
truth
of
it
i
shall
always
be
coming
to
see
you
at
your
new
home
you
know
so
that
my
absence
now
will
not
matter
then
i
give
in
do
whatever
will
be
most
comfortable
to
yourself
clym
retired
to
his
lodging
at
the
housetop
much
relieved
and
occupied
himself
during
the
afternoon
in
noting
down
the
heads
of
a
sermon
with
which
he
intended
to
initiate
all
that
really
seemed
practicable
of
the
scheme
that
had
originally
brought
him
hither
and
that
he
had
so
long
kept
in
view
under
various
modifications
and
through
evil
and
good
report
he
had
tested
and
weighed
his
convictions
again
and
again
and
saw
no
reason
to
alter
them
though
he
had
considerably
lessened
his
plan
his
eyesight
by
long
humouring
in
his
native
air
had
grown
stronger
but
not
sufficiently
strong
to
warrant
his
attempting
his
extensive
educational
project
yet
he
did
not
repine
there
was
still
more
than
enough
of
an
unambitious
sort
to
tax
all
his
energies
and
occupy
all
his
hours
evening
drew
on
and
sounds
of
life
and
movement
in
the
lower
part
of
the
domicile
became
more
pronounced
the
gate
in
the
palings
clicking
incessantly
the
party
was
to
be
an
early
one
and
all
the
guests
were
assembled
long
before
it
was
dark
yeobright
went
down
the
back
staircase
and
into
the
heath
by
another
path
than
that
in
front
intending
to
walk
in
the
open
air
till
the
party
was
over
when
he
would
return
to
wish
thomasin
and
her
husband
good
bye
as
they
departed
his
steps
were
insensibly
bent
towards
mistover
by
the
path
that
he
had
followed
on
that
terrible
morning
when
he
learnt
the
strange
news
from
susan
s
boy
he
did
not
turn
aside
to
the
cottage
but
pushed
on
to
an
eminence
whence
he
could
see
over
the
whole
quarter
that
had
once
been
eustacia
s
home
while
he
stood
observing
the
darkening
scene
somebody
came
up
clym
seeing
him
but
dimly
would
have
let
him
pass
silently
had
not
the
pedestrian
who
was
charley
recognized
the
young
man
and
spoken
to
him
charley
i
have
not
seen
you
for
a
length
of
time
said
yeobright
do
you
often
walk
this
way
no
the
lad
replied
i
don
t
often
come
outside
the
bank
you
were
not
at
the
maypole
no
said
charley
in
the
same
listless
tone
i
don
t
care
for
that
sort
of
thing
now
you
rather
liked
miss
eustacia
didn
t
you
yeobright
gently
asked
eustacia
had
frequently
told
him
of
charley
s
romantic
attachment
yes
very
much
ah
i
wish
yes
i
wish
mr
yeobright
you
could
give
me
something
to
keep
that
once
belonged
to
her
if
you
don
t
mind
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
it
will
give
me
very
great
pleasure
charley
let
me
think
what
i
have
of
hers
that
you
would
like
but
come
with
me
to
the
house
and
i
ll
see
they
walked
towards
blooms
end
together
when
they
reached
the
front
it
was
dark
and
the
shutters
were
closed
so
that
nothing
of
the
interior
could
be
seen
come
round
this
way
said
clym
my
entrance
is
at
the
back
for
the
present
the
two
went
round
and
ascended
the
crooked
stair
in
darkness
till
clym
s
sitting
room
on
the
upper
floor
was
reached
where
he
lit
a
candle
charley
entering
gently
behind
yeobright
searched
his
desk
and
taking
out
a
sheet
of
tissue
paper
unfolded
from
it
two
or
three
undulating
locks
of
raven
hair
which
fell
over
the
paper
like
black
streams
from
these
he
selected
one
wrapped
it
up
and
gave
it
to
the
lad
whose
eyes
had
filled
with
tears
he
kissed
the
packet
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
said
in
a
voice
of
emotion
o
mr
clym
how
good
you
are
to
me
i
will
go
a
little
way
with
you
said
clym
and
amid
the
noise
of
merriment
from
below
they
descended
their
path
to
the
front
led
them
close
to
a
little
side
window
whence
the
rays
of
candles
streamed
across
the
shrubs
the
window
being
screened
from
general
observation
by
the
bushes
had
been
left
unblinded
so
that
a
person
in
this
private
nook
could
see
all
that
was
going
on
within
the
room
which
contained
the
wedding
guests
except
in
so
far
as
vision
was
hindered
by
the
green
antiquity
of
the
panes
charley
what
are
they
doing
said
clym
my
sight
is
weaker
again
tonight
and
the
glass
of
this
window
is
not
good
charley
wiped
his
own
eyes
which
were
rather
blurred
with
moisture
and
stepped
closer
to
the
casement
mr
venn
is
asking
christian
cantle
to
sing
he
replied
and
christian
is
moving
about
in
his
chair
as
if
he
were
much
frightened
at
the
question
and
his
father
has
struck
up
a
stave
instead
of
him
yes
i
can
hear
the
old
man
s
voice
said
clym
so
there
s
to
be
no
dancing
i
suppose
and
is
thomasin
in
the
room
i
see
something
moving
in
front
of
the
candles
that
resembles
her
shape
i
think
yes
she
do
seem
happy
she
is
red
in
the
face
and
laughing
at
something
fairway
has
said
to
her
o
my
what
noise
was
that
said
clym
mr
venn
is
so
tall
that
he
knocked
his
head
against
the
beam
in
gieing
a
skip
as
he
passed
under
mrs
venn
has
run
up
quite
frightened
and
now
she
s
put
her
hand
to
his
head
to
feel
if
there
s
a
lump
and
now
they
be
all
laughing
again
as
if
nothing
had
happened
do
any
of
them
seem
to
care
about
my
not
being
there
clym
asked
no
not
a
bit
in
the
world
now
they
are
all
holding
up
their
glasses
and
drinking
somebody
s
health
i
wonder
if
it
is
mine
no
tis
mr
and
mrs
venn
s
because
he
is
making
a
hearty
sort
of
speech
there
now
mrs
venn
has
got
up
and
is
going
away
to
put
on
her
things
i
think
well
they
haven
t
concerned
themselves
about
me
and
it
is
quite
right
they
should
not
it
is
all
as
it
should
be
and
thomasin
at
least
is
happy
we
will
not
stay
any
longer
now
as
they
will
soon
be
coming
out
to
go
home
he
accompanied
the
lad
into
the
heath
on
his
way
home
and
returning
alone
to
the
house
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
found
venn
and
thomasin
ready
to
start
all
the
guests
having
departed
in
his
absence
the
wedded
pair
took
their
seats
in
the
four
wheeled
dogcart
which
venn
s
head
milker
and
handy
man
had
driven
from
stickleford
to
fetch
them
in
little
eustacia
and
the
nurse
were
packed
securely
upon
the
open
flap
behind
and
the
milker
on
an
ancient
overstepping
pony
whose
shoes
clashed
like
cymbals
at
every
tread
rode
in
the
rear
in
the
manner
of
a
body
servant
of
the
last
century
now
we
leave
you
in
absolute
possession
of
your
own
house
again
said
thomasin
as
she
bent
down
to
wish
her
cousin
good
night
it
will
be
rather
lonely
for
you
clym
after
the
hubbub
we
have
been
making
o
that
s
no
inconvenience
said
clym
smiling
rather
sadly
and
then
the
party
drove
off
and
vanished
in
the
night
shades
and
yeobright
entered
the
house
the
ticking
of
the
clock
was
the
only
sound
that
greeted
him
for
not
a
soul
remained
christian
who
acted
as
cook
valet
and
gardener
to
clym
sleeping
at
his
father
s
house
yeobright
sat
down
in
one
of
the
vacant
chairs
and
remained
in
thought
a
long
time
his
mother
s
old
chair
was
opposite
it
had
been
sat
in
that
evening
by
those
who
had
scarcely
remembered
that
it
ever
was
hers
but
to
clym
she
was
almost
a
presence
there
now
as
always
whatever
she
was
in
other
people
s
memories
in
his
she
was
the
sublime
saint
whose
radiance
even
his
tenderness
for
eustacia
could
not
obscure
but
his
heart
was
heavy
that
mother
had
not
crowned
him
in
the
day
of
his
espousals
and
in
the
day
of
the
gladness
of
his
heart
and
events
had
borne
out
the
accuracy
of
her
judgment
and
proved
the
devotedness
of
her
care
he
should
have
heeded
her
for
eustacia
s
sake
even
more
than
for
his
own
it
was
all
my
fault
he
whispered
o
my
mother
my
mother
would
to
god
that
i
could
live
my
life
again
and
endure
for
you
what
you
endured
for
me
on
the
sunday
after
this
wedding
an
unusual
sight
was
to
be
seen
on
rainbarrow
from
a
distance
there
simply
appeared
to
be
a
motionless
figure
standing
on
the
top
of
the
tumulus
just
as
eustacia
had
stood
on
that
lonely
summit
some
two
years
and
a
half
before
but
now
it
was
fine
warm
weather
with
only
a
summer
breeze
blowing
and
early
afternoon
instead
of
dull
twilight
those
who
ascended
to
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
barrow
perceived
that
the
erect
form
in
the
centre
piercing
the
sky
was
not
really
alone
round
him
upon
the
slopes
of
the
barrow
a
number
of
heathmen
and
women
were
reclining
or
sitting
at
their
ease
they
listened
to
the
words
of
the
man
in
their
midst
who
was
preaching
while
they
abstractedly
pulled
heather
stripped
ferns
or
tossed
pebbles
down
the
slope
this
was
the
first
of
a
series
of
moral
lectures
or
sermons
on
the
mount
which
were
to
be
delivered
from
the
same
place
every
sunday
afternoon
as
long
as
the
fine
weather
lasted
the
commanding
elevation
of
rainbarrow
had
been
chosen
for
two
reasons
first
that
it
occupied
a
central
position
among
the
remote
cottages
around
secondly
that
the
preacher
thereon
could
be
seen
from
all
adjacent
points
as
soon
as
he
arrived
at
his
post
the
view
of
him
being
thus
a
convenient
signal
to
those
stragglers
who
wished
to
draw
near
the
speaker
was
bareheaded
and
the
breeze
at
each
waft
gently
lifted
and
lowered
his
hair
somewhat
too
thin
for
a
man
of
his
years
these
still
numbering
less
than
thirty
three
he
wore
a
shade
over
his
eyes
and
his
face
was
pensive
and
lined
but
though
these
bodily
features
were
marked
with
decay
there
was
no
defect
in
the
tones
of
his
voice
which
were
rich
musical
and
stirring
he
stated
that
his
discourses
to
people
were
to
be
sometimes
secular
and
sometimes
religious
but
never
dogmatic
and
that
his
texts
would
be
taken
from
all
kinds
of
books
this
afternoon
the
words
were
as
follows
and
the
king
rose
up
to
meet
her
and
bowed
himself
unto
her
and
sat
down
on
his
throne
and
caused
a
seat
to
be
set
for
the
king
s
mother
and
she
sat
on
his
right
hand
then
she
said
i
desire
one
small
petition
of
thee
i
pray
thee
say
me
not
nay
and
the
king
said
unto
her
ask
on
my
mother
for
i
will
not
say
thee
nay
yeobright
had
in
fact
found
his
vocation
in
the
career
of
an
itinerant
open
air
preacher
and
lecturer
on
morally
unimpeachable
subjects
and
from
this
day
he
laboured
incessantly
in
that
office
speaking
not
only
in
simple
language
on
rainbarrow
and
in
the
hamlets
round
but
in
a
more
cultivated
strain
elsewhere
from
the
steps
and
porticoes
of
town
halls
from
market
crosses
from
conduits
on
esplanades
and
on
wharves
from
the
parapets
of
bridges
in
barns
and
outhouses
and
all
other
such
places
in
the
neighbouring
wessex
towns
and
villages
he
left
alone
creeds
and
systems
of
philosophy
finding
enough
and
more
than
enough
to
occupy
his
tongue
in
the
opinions
and
actions
common
to
all
good
men
some
believed
him
and
some
believed
not
some
said
that
his
words
were
commonplace
others
complained
of
his
want
of
theological
doctrine
while
others
again
remarked
that
it
was
well
enough
for
a
man
to
take
to
preaching
who
could
not
see
to
do
anything
else
but
everywhere
he
was
kindly
received
for
the
story
of
his
life
had
become
generally
known
