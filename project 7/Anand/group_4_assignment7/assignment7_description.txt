For this project we used our project 4 as a base for our project since it was
an animation of the pac-man game and we added manual controls, lives, a timer,
a beginning screen, a pause screen and menu, and a death screen with the option
to restart the game. The pac-man class was done by Isaac, the pellets class was
done by Dylan, the ghost class was done by Anand, and the main file was done by
all of us. The game starts with the beginning screen prompting users to press b
to begin the game. Once this is pressed the game allows the player to press w
for up, s for down, a for left, and d for right. The objective of the game is to
collect all the pellets without the ghost getting to you. If the ghost does get
to the pac-man then the game restarts with one life of 3 deducted. If all three
lives are lost then the game goes to a death screen where it prompts the user to
press r to restart the game and if pressed then the game returns to the
beginning screen. In the game if the user presses p then the game is
paused and the user is prompted to press c to continue the game or q to quit the
game. If quit then the game returns to the beginning screen. The score goes up
by 100 when a pellet is eaten.
