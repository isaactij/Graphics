Our animation is a tree in the ocean with waves going around it and a sun
floating in the sky. Our three classes are ocean_class, sun_class, and
tree_class. The ocean_class was done by Dylan and it is a 3D object that moves
up and down and side to side to imitate waves in the ocean. The challenges
here was the initial idea was to have triangles moving toward the camera,
but it proved a challenge to do this. The sun_class was done by Anand and it is
a sphere that rotates and moves in the sky and changes color over time to
represent the rise and setting of the sun. The challenge here was getting the
sun in the camera view. The tree_class was done by Isaac and it is a palm tree
that when the wind (represented by lines) blows some of the leaves blow to the
side and all of the leaves shake and then the leaves go to their original
positions. The challenge here was getting the rotation correct for the leaves
when they move to the side and shake.
