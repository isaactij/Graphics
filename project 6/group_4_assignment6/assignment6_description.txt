This intended simulation depicts a flock of birds as they attempt to avoid a hawk predator and a vulture scavenger that eats up dead birds after they have been killed by the predator.

The predator class observes the birds, then accelerates towards, and kills the lead bird. Once the predator kills the lead bird it stops for a moment and the resumes.

The scavenger collects, or eats, the dead birds as they are falling to the ground. In between 'feedings' the vulture stays to the side and waits. 

The birds move on their own when not in danger. When the predator comes close enough they move to avoid it as much as possible. When the predator and the leader bird have the same coordinate the bird dies and it falls down and is picked up by the scavenger. When the lead bird dies the rest of the birds adjust to know which is the new lead bird. Each bird has its own leader unless it is the main leader. When the predator is stopped the birds ignore it and move in their normal manner.

In this project, we were able to finish all the of the objectives we planned in the progress report. 

Isaac was responsible for the birds, Dylan for the predator, and Anand for the scavenger. This project was different in that it required us to integrate our parts more closely than before, so we had to periodically check each others progress to update our own parts.
