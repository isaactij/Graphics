Isaac worked on part 3. In this part the data is taken from BBC news. The first
page is Science and Environment and is color coded yellow. The second page is
technology and is color coded red. The third page is Entertainments and Arts and
is color coded white. The fourth page is Business and color coded blue. The fifth
page is UK Politics and is color coded pink. The default page is the first one
and when one of the page buttons is pressed the page changes to the one selected.
The buttons up and down scroll the page up and down to see all of the feed items.
When the mouse goes over one of the article titles the title changes to green and
a short description appears on the right side in green. In the program code the
page group_4_assignment8_part3 is the main page. The class button makes the buttons
and handles their location, color, and display. The class hover is used to notify
when the mouse is over an article title.
