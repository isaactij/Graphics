Project functionality: use arrow keys to dodge and jump past enemies. Other enemies can be shot with fireballs using 'f' in order to kill them. The end flag is the goal, upon which reached, will end the game and grant you the glory of victory. Press 'v' to trigger music and press 'p'to pause.

Classes:

	death_screen: This class displays the death screen upon death

	fireball: This class draws the fireballs that mario can shoot

	flag: This class draws the flag/victory indicator

	mario: This class implements the proper gravity, acceleration, and velocity physics that allow the main character to move. This class also draws the main cahracter

	mushroom: This class draws the mushroom enemies and makes them move back and forth

	platform: This class displays the background blocks

	tube: This class displays the background tubes(not used)

Contributions:
	
	Dylan: Implemented the Mario movements physics, Mario movment physics interacting with the camera, and the flag and victory

	Isaac: Implemented Sprites, mushrooms, platform, and tube classes

	Anand: Implemented the mario fireball, camera motion, Victoy condition, background


Difficulties: The most difficult things we ran into were camera motion and implementing sprites. These were mostly overcome though through determination
