The animation is a game of Pac-Man that plays itself and is random each time.
The four classes are group_4_assignment4, ghost_class, pacman, and pellet. The
group_4_assignment4 is the main class that runs the program. It calls on the other
three classes, controlls when to reset the game, and plays the sound file. The
ghost_class was created by Anand and controls how the ghost looks, the way the
eyes move, and the way the ghost navigates the maze. The eyes change position
depending on which direction the ghost is going. The pacman class was created by
Isaac and controls how the pacman looks, the way the mouth moves, and how it
navigates the maze. The mouth opens and closes throughout gameplay. The pellet
class was created by Dylan and controls how the pellets look, the way they move, 
and when they disappear. The pellets move back and forth in place and when
pacman goes over them they disappear. Even though each part was created by one
person we all did help eachother in tough situations. Some unexpected challenges
were getting the math correct when creating the maze so all paths were the same
width and when creating the track pacman and the ghost follows to get it right
in the middle of all the paths. Another challenge was getting the eyes on the
ghosts moving correctly and in a timely manner and getting the pellets to
disappear when pacman went over them. The animation runs infinitely.
